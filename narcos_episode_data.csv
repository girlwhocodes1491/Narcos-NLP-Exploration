03x10 - Going Back to Cali,"[<div class=""content"">Hey!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, ladies.<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking for something?<br/>
<br/>
We're just taking a ride.<br/>
<br/>
Can't we pass?<br/>
<br/>
No, sweetheart. You have to go back.<br/>
<br/>
Listen...<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to hang out later<br/>
back in town?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
I said...<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no!<br/>
<br/>
Julio.<br/>
Pacho, you f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck dog!<br/>
<br/>
Let me go!<br/>
<br/>
Let go of me!<br/>
<br/>
Let me go!<br/>
<br/>
Let go...!<br/>
<br/>
You.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Salazar.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what makes me happy, Pacho?<br/>
<br/>
Makes me very happy?<br/>
<br/>
That my sons didn't k*ll<br/>
your brother Alvaro.<br/>
<br/>
Because he's going to live<br/>
the rest of his life...<br/>
<br/>
as half a man. Half man, half...<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>
<br/>
the great event of the surrender<br/>
<br/>
of Helmer Herrera, to Colombian justice.<br/>
<br/>
And this incident<br/>
marked the end of the Cali cartel...<br/>
<br/>
who were responsible,<br/>
according to international sources,<br/>
<br/>
for more than 80%<br/>
of the cocaine tr*ffick in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout my campaign and presidency,<br/>
<br/>
I committed to dismantling<br/>
all narcotrafficking networks,<br/>
<br/>
and we're doing it.<br/>
<br/>
The Colombian government<br/>
was quick to claim victory.<br/>
<br/>
The arrest of Miguel Rodriguez<br/>
and the surrenders of Pacho Herrera...<br/>
<br/>
and Chepe Santacruz...<br/>
<br/>
looked like big wins<br/>
in The w*r on Drugs.<br/>
<br/>
But they were bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
The only real victory belonged<br/>
to the godfathers of Cali,<br/>
<br/>
safely ensconced in a Bogoti?jail...<br/>
<br/>
Leave that there.<br/>
<br/>
still billionaires,<br/>
<br/>
submitting to a justice<br/>
that they had bought and paid for.<br/>
<br/>
They didn't need to build<br/>
their own prison.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, sweetie.<br/>
<br/>
The minimum security wing of La Picota<br/>
would do just fine.<br/>
<br/>
They wouldn't be there long.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto. How've you been?<br/>
<br/>
Good, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Grateful that we're all together.<br/>
<br/>
The investment we made in our friends<br/>
can bear fruit.<br/>
<br/>
And then all this will pass away<br/>
<br/>
like some old joke<br/>
you can't quite remember.<br/>
<br/>
For this, gentlemen, I propose a toast.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you would.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.<br/>
<br/>
You all know this wasn't what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
So it's very hard for me to admit<br/>
that I know this is for the best.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to you, we're on the<br/>
verge of, how do you call it?<br/>
<br/>
""A great victory.""<br/>
<br/>
We believe in you.<br/>
<br/>
To my brother, Gilberto. Our leader.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen of Cali... salud!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Pena.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Can we talk?<br/>
Yeah. Give me a second.<br/>
<br/>
Go with your mom.<br/>
<br/>
Checked with the embassy,<br/>
finishing up paperwork this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
You're on a flight tomorrow.<br/>
First thing.<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
You have any idea where we can find him?<br/>
No. Why do you need him?<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez<br/>
gave six million dollars<br/>
<br/>
to Samper's presidential campaign.<br/>
<br/>
So unless we get Pallomari in the States<br/>
testifying on the cartel,<br/>
<br/>
generating new indictments...<br/>
<br/>
What are you telling me?<br/>
The godfathers won't stay locked up.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think's gonna happen<br/>
to my family<br/>
<br/>
if these men keep all their money,<br/>
all their power?<br/>
<br/>
Well, Witness Protection Services will<br/>
provide security for as long as you need.<br/>
<br/>
Pallomari's wife is having an affair.<br/>
<br/>
With who?<br/>
Some guy at her office. Fredy Moya.<br/>
<br/>
Phones in the cartel safe house,<br/>
they're tapped.<br/>
<br/>
I overheard a conversation between them.<br/>
It didn't sound like business.<br/>
<br/>
And he can keep them in prison?<br/>
<br/>
We find Pallomari or<br/>
the godfathers walk.<br/>
<br/>
You're not gonna find him without me.<br/>
<br/>
You're right.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Director.<br/>
<br/>
Don Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Please, go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
To all the k*ll<br/>
And the 100-dollar billers<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
It's me.<br/>
<br/>
Where are we on Pallomari?<br/>
We put Navegante on it, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
I'll find him, don't worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
And f*cking Salcedo too, you'll see.<br/>
<br/>
David, don't take your eye off Henao.<br/>
<br/>
That f*ck might see this<br/>
as an opportunity. Keep a low profile.<br/>
<br/>
You heard of us<br/>
<br/>
Sure, don't worry.<br/>
The Mobb comes equipped with warfare<br/>
<br/>
How's Mari?a?<br/>
I really don't know.<br/>
<br/>
How come you don't know?<br/>
Make sure she's taken care of.<br/>
<br/>
It's very important<br/>
you handle Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
That f*ck could ruin everything.<br/>
<br/>
Call me when it's done.<br/>
<br/>
Like they supposed to<br/>
<br/>
They come around<br/>
But they never come close to<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo?<br/>
I need your help, Gonzalo.<br/>
<br/>
You know I can't get involved.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is going to happen to you.<br/>
When has anything happened to you?<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking you for legal advice,<br/>
and quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I've decided that the best way<br/>
to get out of this situation<br/>
<br/>
is to turn myself in to the authorities.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, normally that would be the case.<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
But the problem is you already<br/>
have a warrant out for your arrest.<br/>
<br/>
An arrest warrant?<br/>
<br/>
The police won't protect you.<br/>
In fact, they'll probably k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the head accountant.<br/>
<br/>
And every dollar in this organization,<br/>
and every secret,<br/>
<br/>
has been through this head.<br/>
It's all in here.<br/>
<br/>
Tell whoever needs to know<br/>
I'm willing to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo, my advice to you<br/>
is to get your family and leave Cali.<br/>
<br/>
My wife's very attached to her work.<br/>
<br/>
What? I don't understand.<br/>
You know her, she's stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
She built her business<br/>
from the ground up.<br/>
<br/>
I can't leave without her.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Guillermo... this is not<br/>
my legal advice, but as your friend...<br/>
<br/>
talk some sense into your wife.<br/>
Immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get me a g*n?<br/>
<br/>
We'll have to look out for ourselves<br/>
the rest of our lives,<br/>
<br/>
but if I help them...<br/>
<br/>
maybe one day<br/>
we can come back to Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Are you insane? They almost k*ll us.<br/>
<br/>
They almost k*ll us, and now you're<br/>
telling me you want to go back? To Cali?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think<br/>
we can come back to Colombia?<br/>
<br/>
The moment we come back to Colombia,<br/>
they'll k*ll our daughters.<br/>
<br/>
Are you doing this to make up<br/>
for the last four years of your life?<br/>
<br/>
I'm a good man.<br/>
<br/>
I was a good man.<br/>
<br/>
I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not waiting for you.<br/>
<br/>
Wait for me, okay? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
That way.<br/>
<br/>
Keep looking for him.<br/>
No more f*cking excuses.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard from your father?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
David, I've been wondering about<br/>
the arrangement I had for my son and...<br/>
<br/>
Arrangement?<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was true love.<br/>
<br/>
Your father knows I care about him.<br/>
<br/>
That's beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the thing...<br/>
<br/>
You don't mean anything to me.<br/>
<br/>
You're not my mother.<br/>
<br/>
You're not my f*cking problem.<br/>
<br/>
David...<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck do I owe you?<br/>
<br/>
Mari?a.<br/>
<br/>
Open your legs for someone else.<br/>
You're good at that.<br/>
<br/>
Okay?<br/>
<br/>
Once we step off this plane,<br/>
whatever goes down is on me.<br/>
<br/>
We are way off the well-lit path.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Good afternoon, Mr. Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Espinosa's still at lunch.<br/>
He should be back soon.<br/>
<br/>
We'll wait for him inside.<br/>
Okay, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Another drink?<br/>
<br/>
I need to go. See you next week.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
How are the girls here?<br/>
<br/>
The best of Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Open it!<br/>
<br/>
Get in.<br/>
<br/>
Get in, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
ACCESS RESTRICTED PASSWORD REQUIRED<br/>
<br/>
Good afternoon.<br/>
Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for Fredy Moya.<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
The one wearing purple.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Don't pull my chain.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
You work with Patricia Pallomari?<br/>
<br/>
Javier Pena, DEA.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call you back.<br/>
<br/>
Patricia's taken<br/>
a temporary leave of absence.<br/>
<br/>
That so?<br/>
<br/>
You have any idea where I can find her?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't know.<br/>
<br/>
She in trouble?<br/>
<br/>
No, but her husband is.<br/>
<br/>
There's a warrant out for his arrest<br/>
and a pretty substantial reward.<br/>
<br/>
Any information is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
It's me.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, I can't talk right now.<br/>
Call me back later.<br/>
<br/>
No. Wait, I can't call you back. Wait.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'd have to check<br/>
my records in the office.<br/>
<br/>
I can't talk.<br/>
<br/>
Wait.<br/>
Patricia, the DEA was just here.<br/>
<br/>
The DEA. Asking questions.<br/>
<br/>
What did you tell them?<br/>
To go f*ck themselves.<br/>
<br/>
They want Guillermo, not you.<br/>
<br/>
Can't talk. Discuss it later.<br/>
That's her.<br/>
<br/>
They talked about reward.<br/>
<br/>
So, she used the line<br/>
<br/>
in an apartment<br/>
in the north part of the city.<br/>
<br/>
We need to take advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Need to use the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
Work again?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Open the window this time.<br/>
<br/>
This way.<br/>
<br/>
I'd offer a drink,<br/>
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.<br/>
<br/>
Have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Don Orlando,<br/>
I'm here to ask for your protection.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
You don't feel safe?<br/>
<br/>
I did what I had to<br/>
after my husband died.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm in your home...<br/>
ready to do what I have to again.<br/>
<br/>
So what is it you're offering me?<br/>
<br/>
In here.<br/>
<br/>
How was the drive?<br/>
<br/>
It was easy.<br/>
<br/>
Nice place.<br/>
<br/>
Let me start by thanking you<br/>
for the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
We're both busy men.<br/>
I won't waste your time.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm a business man, like you.<br/>
<br/>
The information you seek maybe,<br/>
maybe, maybe is in my possession.<br/>
<br/>
If we come to an arrangement,<br/>
my information becomes yours.<br/>
<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
On the phone,<br/>
you told me you know where Pallomari is.<br/>
<br/>
Correct?<br/>
<br/>
Look, let me put it this way...<br/>
<br/>
Patricia and I are in love.<br/>
<br/>
We want to be together.<br/>
<br/>
So Guillermo's a problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
From what I've heard,<br/>
he's a problem for you too. Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
You are correct.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe we can help each other.<br/>
<br/>
If we come to an arrangement,<br/>
my information becomes yours.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Let me fix you a drink. Okay?<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
By the way...<br/>
are you guys running Windows 95 yet?<br/>
<br/>
Think we're going to wait for next year.<br/>
<br/>
Where the f*ck is Pallomari, you f*g?<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Here's the milk. Just a few<br/>
minutes and then you go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Get in your room.<br/>
Who is it? Who is it?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Get in your room. Quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Drop the g*n! Put it down!<br/>
Drop your w*apon!<br/>
<br/>
It's okay.<br/>
They're the gringos.<br/>
<br/>
Calm down.<br/>
Do you know them?<br/>
<br/>
They came to my office.<br/>
Put the g*n down.<br/>
<br/>
Close the door.<br/>
<br/>
We're here to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Close the door.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Okay.<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Lower your g*n. You understand?<br/>
<br/>
I'd put the safety on.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to sit?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, DEA, are we speaking English<br/>
or Spanish or...? I don't give a shit.<br/>
<br/>
Colombians have a warrant<br/>
for your arrest.<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
And the cartel wants you d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
I'm well aware of that.<br/>
<br/>
The only way you survive this is if<br/>
we get you out to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo.<br/>
<br/>
The United States.<br/>
<br/>
We have your ledger.<br/>
<br/>
You decode it for us<br/>
and you testify on what you know...<br/>
<br/>
That's quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
and we make sure<br/>
that you and your family are safe.<br/>
<br/>
Which place in the United States?<br/>
I'm not sure. We have a program that...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know. The program.<br/>
<br/>
But if I'm giving up my life...<br/>
<br/>
I want to know what I'm getting for it.<br/>
<br/>
For instance,<br/>
which kind of house will we have?<br/>
<br/>
My family requires<br/>
a certain amount of square footage.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't hard for us to find you<br/>
and it won't be hard for them.<br/>
<br/>
You understand that?<br/>
<br/>
This is your chance<br/>
to keep your family alive.<br/>
<br/>
We will negotiate the details later.<br/>
<br/>
This is the only option you have.<br/>
Do you understand that?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you pack your things,<br/>
as little as possible.<br/>
<br/>
No, Guillermo.<br/>
We can't leave for at least a week.<br/>
<br/>
You heard them.<br/>
The company. I can't just leave.<br/>
<br/>
We must go.<br/>
I need at least a week.<br/>
<br/>
Okay!<br/>
<br/>
Put the radio on the dash...<br/>
and your hands on the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
How are you, Jorge Salcedo?<br/>
<br/>
Help your kids pack,<br/>
let me talk to your wife.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I know about Fredy Moya.<br/>
It's none of my business.<br/>
<br/>
You're right. It's not your problem.<br/>
<br/>
You realize what happens<br/>
if they find you?<br/>
<br/>
And your kids?<br/>
<br/>
I have to say goodbye to him.<br/>
<br/>
We're in love. I can't leave like that.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Pallomari, if you stay, you die.<br/>
<br/>
Understood?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be honest with you.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is...<br/>
<br/>
I was very disappointed to hear<br/>
you were the f*cking rat.<br/>
<br/>
But I still like you.<br/>
<br/>
It's all good.<br/>
I'm not going to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
David Rodriguez...<br/>
<br/>
he wants to do it himself personally,<br/>
you know?<br/>
<br/>
That's fine by me.<br/>
<br/>
That way,<br/>
our friendship will remain intact.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
The jacket...<br/>
Okay, that's it. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
We're on our way down.<br/>
<br/>
Salcedo, we're in the lobby now.<br/>
<br/>
Are we clear?<br/>
<br/>
Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them to come out.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge, we clear or not?<br/>
<br/>
Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
All clear.<br/>
<br/>
Copy.<br/>
<br/>
All right, stay close.<br/>
<br/>
Let's finish this.<br/>
<br/>
Put the g*n down.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
We both know that's a lie.<br/>
<br/>
Get down! Get behind the car!<br/>
<br/>
Over there!<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck happened?<br/>
<br/>
He has the keys.<br/>
<br/>
Let's move!<br/>
Come on, get in the car!<br/>
<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
Drive.<br/>
Patricia!<br/>
<br/>
Don't look!<br/>
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!<br/>
<br/>
Don't look! Don't look at that!<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck is he doing here?<br/>
<br/>
He saved your life!<br/>
Get in the f*cking car!<br/>
<br/>
Open! Open!<br/>
<br/>
Be careful, be careful. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Move, move, move!<br/>
<br/>
What happened? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
They k*ll Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
And Pallomari?<br/>
<br/>
The f*ck's gone.<br/>
<br/>
You sure?<br/>
<br/>
We're going to the airport.<br/>
We're going to catch those...<br/>
<br/>
We're leaving, now!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
You, come with me.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to the airport.<br/>
Take the guys. Now, now, now!<br/>
<br/>
That's the North Valley, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Who do they think they're messing with?<br/>
<br/>
You just got smoked, bitches.<br/>
<br/>
Boss!<br/>
<br/>
Boss!<br/>
<br/>
Let's go. Out.<br/>
<br/>
Could you open, please?<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
There you go.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Patricia, get out this way.<br/>
Careful, my love.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
What's this?<br/>
<br/>
You're wanted by the CNP.<br/>
<br/>
We can't aid the escape of a fugitive,<br/>
so you've gotta fly yourself out.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see that?<br/>
We have a private plane.<br/>
<br/>
We have a plane just for us.<br/>
<br/>
If you could sign here, sir?<br/>
<br/>
Me? Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You have to pay for the plane.<br/>
Whatever you have on you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't carry that kind of cash.<br/>
<br/>
It's just a technicality.<br/>
So that it's not kidnapping.<br/>
<br/>
Just a moment.<br/>
<br/>
If it's just a technicality...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Get on the plane. Go.<br/>
Everything is going to be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Come on. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye, Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, my next<br/>
witness has direct, first-hand knowledge<br/>
<br/>
of the criminal activities<br/>
uncovered by Operation Cornerstone.<br/>
<br/>
Please state your name, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
And you were an accountant<br/>
for the Cali cartel?<br/>
<br/>
No, I was the chief accountant.<br/>
The chief.<br/>
<br/>
El jefe.<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo Pallomari had a lot to say.<br/>
<br/>
And he said it in federal courtrooms<br/>
from Miami to New York City.<br/>
<br/>
This is the ledger of Mr. Pallomaro<br/>
that only he himself can interpret.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Your Honor, my English is not<br/>
quite good, but his Spanish is awful.<br/>
<br/>
Can you repeat my name?<br/>
""Pallomari."" It's so simple.<br/>
<br/>
And people were<br/>
interested in what he had to say,<br/>
<br/>
especially about the cartel's influence<br/>
with the Colombian government.<br/>
<br/>
So that government<br/>
went on the defensive.<br/>
<br/>
And we have total agreement<br/>
in that these testimonies<br/>
<br/>
that we have heard from Mr. Pallomari<br/>
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
The damage was done.<br/>
<br/>
It would be most helpful if the Colombian<br/>
president, who's head of the government<br/>
<br/>
was as dedicated to fighting narcotics<br/>
tr*ffick as many of the people<br/>
<br/>
in his own government.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. House and Senate began<br/>
making noise about decertification,<br/>
<br/>
turning Colombia from an ally<br/>
in The w*r on Drugs into an enemy,<br/>
<br/>
thr*at to choke off<br/>
the vital foreign aid<br/>
<br/>
that served the shadowy interests<br/>
of both nations.<br/>
<br/>
And that scared people.<br/>
<br/>
Enough to see justice finally done?<br/>
<br/>
Well, governments don't work that way.<br/>
<br/>
Know how many times I've gotten a call<br/>
<br/>
from the Department of Justice<br/>
and State the same morning?<br/>
<br/>
Count 'em on one finger.<br/>
<br/>
Guess we have you to thank for that.<br/>
<br/>
I'm headed over<br/>
to the National Palace right now,<br/>
<br/>
to make clear to President Samper<br/>
himself that the godfathers stay in jail.<br/>
<br/>
At least for the foreseeable future.<br/>
But that's as far as it goes?<br/>
<br/>
We drew up a draft indictment outlining<br/>
<br/>
President Samper's ties<br/>
to the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Alleged ties.<br/>
<br/>
And I suggest you keep that draft<br/>
to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The DOJ's not going to topple<br/>
a government, Agent Pena.<br/>
<br/>
You can't tell me<br/>
you're surprised by that.<br/>
<br/>
Some part of me was holding out hope,<br/>
I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you should tell that part<br/>
to grow the f*ck up.<br/>
<br/>
No, I mean it, Agent Pena.<br/>
You should be happy.<br/>
<br/>
You played the system<br/>
like a g*dd*mn fiddle.<br/>
<br/>
You won.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Another deal.<br/>
<br/>
A compromise.<br/>
<br/>
A charade.<br/>
<br/>
A way for governments<br/>
who don't give a shit<br/>
<br/>
about the w*r they're supposed<br/>
to be fighting...<br/>
<br/>
to go on pretending they're winning it.<br/>
<br/>
But it can't be won.<br/>
<br/>
It'll never be won.<br/>
<br/>
At least not until people see it<br/>
for what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Not until they know the truth.<br/>
<br/>
You know what it means<br/>
if you go on the record, right?<br/>
<br/>
There'll be a price to pay.<br/>
<br/>
Press the button.<br/>
<br/>
Let's start with your<br/>
name and occupation.<br/>
<br/>
Javier Pena, DEA attachie in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And so the truth got out.<br/>
<br/>
The news that the Cali cartel had<br/>
donated to the president's campaign...<br/>
<br/>
in exchange for virtual immunity...<br/>
<br/>
turned Colombia upside down.<br/>
<br/>
And when the highest-ranking DEA agent<br/>
in the country went on the record<br/>
<br/>
and said not only did<br/>
the United States know about it,<br/>
<br/>
but we allowed it to happen...<br/>
<br/>
they couldn't hide from it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
An exclusive interview.<br/>
<br/>
He accuses the country<br/>
of being a Narco-Democracy.<br/>
<br/>
He said the country<br/>
has fallen into the abyss.<br/>
<br/>
His words have not been well received<br/>
by the Colombian people.<br/>
<br/>
The public is demanding<br/>
an official response from...<br/>
<br/>
You didn't really call<br/>
the country that we're guests in<br/>
<br/>
a ""Narco-Democracy.""<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying it isn't?<br/>
<br/>
The State Department's livid.<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
They're responsible. We all are.<br/>
<br/>
Samper is not going anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Well, at least people know the truth.<br/>
<br/>
I want you gone, Pena.<br/>
So do the Colombians.<br/>
<br/>
I understand, sir.<br/>
<br/>
You know... any aspirations<br/>
you had for your career...<br/>
<br/>
just got dragged behind<br/>
the barn and sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
I resigned from the DEA this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Recordings that link the president<br/>
<br/>
with narcotrafficking have been leaked.<br/>
<br/>
The reality is they need five million.<br/>
<br/>
Uh-huh.<br/>
We're missing three, see?<br/>
<br/>
We have it.<br/>
Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that's done.<br/>
<br/>
This scandal thr*at elected president<br/>
Ernesto Samper's career<br/>
<br/>
if the authorities confirm his campaign<br/>
was funded by narcotrafficking money.<br/>
<br/>
President Samper,<br/>
the only solution is your resignation!<br/>
<br/>
Colombians can be certain...<br/>
<br/>
that if they prove<br/>
any money transfer of any kind,<br/>
<br/>
the deposit would've been made<br/>
behind my back.<br/>
<br/>
The Colombians<br/>
called the scandal ""Proceso 8000.""<br/>
<br/>
And it set into motion<br/>
a series of events...<br/>
<br/>
that finally brought the reign<br/>
of the Cali godfathers to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Chepe Santacruz<br/>
never did make it back to New York.<br/>
<br/>
Without the government's guarantee<br/>
that their sentences would be minimal...<br/>
<br/>
Chepe decided that prison<br/>
wasn't the best place for him to be.<br/>
<br/>
And so... he released himself...<br/>
<br/>
and set out in search of new alliances,<br/>
<br/>
with partners who could help him<br/>
rebuild the empire.<br/>
<br/>
You won't believe who he chose.<br/>
<br/>
Don Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to get your call.<br/>
<br/>
Predictably,<br/>
it wasn't much of a partnership.<br/>
<br/>
It seems the Castanos expected<br/>
a larger contribution to their cause...<br/>
<br/>
than Chepe was comfortable making.<br/>
<br/>
So the alliance died quickly.<br/>
<br/>
And Chepe Santacruz's wild ride...<br/>
came to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Pacho Herrera didn't fare much better<br/>
staying in jail.<br/>
<br/>
Vendettas in the drug game never end.<br/>
<br/>
And Pacho's w*r on the Salazars...<br/>
<br/>
made him some lifelong<br/>
North Valley enemies.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
And as for<br/>
the Rodriguez-Orejuela brothers,<br/>
<br/>
political pressure from the U.S.,<br/>
and a disgraced Colombian president<br/>
<br/>
who needed to prove<br/>
he was tough on narcos...<br/>
<br/>
brought back the only effective w*apon<br/>
we have in The w*r on Drugs: extradition.<br/>
<br/>
All out of favors<br/>
and unlikely to find more,<br/>
<br/>
they will spend the rest of their lives<br/>
in a U.S. prison.<br/>
<br/>
The good guys didn't do much better.<br/>
<br/>
BETRAYAL PAYS<br/>
<br/>
Back in Colombia, Jorge Salcedo<br/>
was publicly branded a rat.<br/>
<br/>
The danger that he put himself in to<br/>
ensure the success of our operation...<br/>
<br/>
And in the States, despite testimony<br/>
<br/>
that he was instrumental to our efforts to<br/>
capture and prosecute the Cali godfathers,<br/>
<br/>
he still had to plead guilty<br/>
to felony conspiracy charges.<br/>
<br/>
And from there, Jorge Salcedo...<br/>
<br/>
the guy who had the most to do<br/>
with bringing down the Cali cartel...<br/>
<br/>
disappeared into the Federal<br/>
Witness Protection Program...<br/>
<br/>
somewhere in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
A prison of its own.<br/>
<br/>
You knew him, right?<br/>
<br/>
Agent Camarena?<br/>
<br/>
Of him.<br/>
My first assignment out of the academy<br/>
<br/>
was a task force that searched for him<br/>
in Guadalajara.<br/>
<br/>
It all started there.<br/>
<br/>
Before him,<br/>
we didn't even know we were in a w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Another hot one down there for you, huh?<br/>
<br/>
You took down the big<br/>
players in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well... we'll make new ones.<br/>
<br/>
Don't turn a victory into a defeat,<br/>
Javier.<br/>
<br/>
The Colombian super-cartels are gone.<br/>
<br/>
And whoever comes next are gonna be<br/>
fighting amongst themselves for years.<br/>
<br/>
They're still only going to be a shadow<br/>
of what Medelli?n and Cali were.<br/>
<br/>
And now it's time to take the fight<br/>
to the real enemy in The w*r on Drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
""The real enemy""?<br/>
<br/>
Let me put in some calls.<br/>
<br/>
I'll make<br/>
this bullshit resignation go away.<br/>
<br/>
What else is a guy like you gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
All right, fellas. Let's move.<br/>
Keep going.<br/>
<br/>
Keep going.<br/>
<br/>
You helping me with this or not?<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was getting a partner.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Pop. Give me that.<br/>
<br/>
Stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
Stand here for an hour<br/>
and you'll count 20 of 'em going by.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
do you have to fix the fence<br/>
every time a storm hits?<br/>
<br/>
Someone has to do it.<br/>
<br/>
That's how life works.<br/>
<br/>
You thinking of taking them up on it?<br/>
<br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
It's different there.<br/>
<br/>
Son, let me tell you...<br/>
Dad.<br/>
<br/>
I've done enough.<br/>
<br/>
I'm through.<br/>
<br/>
Hand me that cutter.</div>]","Hey!

Hey, ladies.

Are you looking for something?

We're just taking a ride.

Can't we pass?

No, sweetheart. You have to go back.

Listen...

Do you want to hang out later
back in town?

What?
I said...

No, no, no!

Julio.
Pacho, you f*ck.

f*ck dog!

Let me go!

Let go of me!

Let me go!

Let go...!

You.

Mrs. Salazar.

Do you know what makes me happy, Pacho?

Makes me very happy?

That my sons didn't k*ll
your brother Alvaro.

Because he's going to live
the rest of his life...

as half a man. Half man, half...

Help!

Help!

the great event of the surrender

of Helmer Herrera, to Colombian justice.

And this incident
marked the end of the Cali cartel...

who were responsible,
according to international sources,

for more than 80%
of the cocaine tr*ffick in the world.

Throughout my campaign and presidency,

I committed to dismantling
all narcotrafficking networks,

and we're doing it.

The Colombian government
was quick to claim victory.

The arrest of Miguel Rodriguez
and the surrenders of Pacho Herrera...

and Chepe Santacruz...

looked like big wins
in The w*r on Drugs.

But they were bullshit.

The only real victory belonged
to the godfathers of Cali,

safely ensconced in a Bogoti?jail...

Leave that there.

still billionaires,

submitting to a justice
that they had bought and paid for.

They didn't need to build
their own prison.

Hello, sweetie.

The minimum security wing of La Picota
would do just fine.

They wouldn't be there long.

Gilberto. How've you been?

Good, brother.

Grateful that we're all together.

The investment we made in our friends
can bear fruit.

And then all this will pass away

like some old joke
you can't quite remember.

For this, gentlemen, I propose a toast.

Of course you would.

f*cking Chepe.

Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.

You all know this wasn't what I wanted.

So it's very hard for me to admit
that I know this is for the best.

And thanks to you, we're on the
verge of, how do you call it?

""A great victory.""

We believe in you.

To my brother, Gilberto. Our leader.

Gentlemen of Cali... salud!

Cheers!

Don't worry about it.

Agent Pena.

Hello.

Can we talk?
Yeah. Give me a second.

Go with your mom.

Checked with the embassy,
finishing up paperwork this afternoon.

You're on a flight tomorrow.
First thing.

Guillermo Pallomari.

You have any idea where we can find him?
No. Why do you need him?

Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez
gave six million dollars

to Samper's presidential campaign.

So unless we get Pallomari in the States
testifying on the cartel,

generating new indictments...

What are you telling me?
The godfathers won't stay locked up.

What do you think's gonna happen
to my family

if these men keep all their money,
all their power?

Well, Witness Protection Services will
provide security for as long as you need.

Pallomari's wife is having an affair.

With who?
Some guy at her office. Fredy Moya.

Phones in the cartel safe house,
they're tapped.

I overheard a conversation between them.
It didn't sound like business.

And he can keep them in prison?

We find Pallomari or
the godfathers walk.

You're not gonna find him without me.

You're right.

Go ahead, sir.

Director.

Don Miguel.

Please, go ahead.

To all the k*ll
And the 100-dollar billers

Hello.
It's me.

Where are we on Pallomari?
We put Navegante on it, Dad.

I'll find him, don't worry about it.

And f*cking Salcedo too, you'll see.

David, don't take your eye off Henao.

That f*ck might see this
as an opportunity. Keep a low profile.

You heard of us

Sure, don't worry.
The Mobb comes equipped with warfare

How's Mari?a?
I really don't know.

How come you don't know?
Make sure she's taken care of.

It's very important
you handle Pallomari.

That f*ck could ruin everything.

Call me when it's done.

Like they supposed to

They come around
But they never come close to

Guillermo?
I need your help, Gonzalo.

You know I can't get involved.

Nothing is going to happen to you.
When has anything happened to you?

I'm asking you for legal advice,
and quickly.

I've decided that the best way
to get out of this situation

is to turn myself in to the authorities.

Yes, normally that would be the case.
Yes.

But the problem is you already
have a warrant out for your arrest.

An arrest warrant?

The police won't protect you.
In fact, they'll probably k*ll you.

I'm the head accountant.

And every dollar in this organization,
and every secret,

has been through this head.
It's all in here.

Tell whoever needs to know
I'm willing to negotiate.

Guillermo, my advice to you
is to get your family and leave Cali.

My wife's very attached to her work.

What? I don't understand.
You know her, she's stubborn.

She built her business
from the ground up.

I can't leave without her.

Look, Guillermo... this is not
my legal advice, but as your friend...

talk some sense into your wife.
Immediately.

Can you get me a g*n?

We'll have to look out for ourselves
the rest of our lives,

but if I help them...

maybe one day
we can come back to Colombia.

Are you insane? They almost k*ll us.

They almost k*ll us, and now you're
telling me you want to go back? To Cali?

Do you really think
we can come back to Colombia?

The moment we come back to Colombia,
they'll k*ll our daughters.

Are you doing this to make up
for the last four years of your life?

I'm a good man.

I was a good man.

I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.

I'm not waiting for you.

Wait for me, okay? Thanks.

That way.

Keep looking for him.
No more f*cking excuses.

Okay.

Yeah?

Have you heard from your father?

Yes.

David, I've been wondering about
the arrangement I had for my son and...

Arrangement?

I thought it was true love.

Your father knows I care about him.

That's beautiful.

Seriously.

But here's the thing...

You don't mean anything to me.

You're not my mother.

You're not my f*cking problem.

David...
What?

What the f*ck do I owe you?

Mari?a.

Open your legs for someone else.
You're good at that.

Okay?

Once we step off this plane,
whatever goes down is on me.

We are way off the well-lit path.

Jorge.

Good afternoon, Mr. Salcedo.

Mr. Espinosa's still at lunch.
He should be back soon.

We'll wait for him inside.
Okay, sir.

Another drink?

I need to go. See you next week.

Excuse me.

How are the girls here?

The best of Cali.

Open it!

Get in.

Get in, f*ck!

Okay.

ACCESS RESTRICTED PASSWORD REQUIRED

Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

I'm looking for Fredy Moya.
Yes.

The one wearing purple.
Thanks.

Don't pull my chain.

I'm looking at the numbers.

Excuse me.
You work with Patricia Pallomari?

Javier Pena, DEA.

I'll call you back.

Patricia's taken
a temporary leave of absence.

That so?

You have any idea where I can find her?

I wouldn't know.

She in trouble?

No, but her husband is.

There's a warrant out for his arrest
and a pretty substantial reward.

Any information is helpful.

Hello.
It's me.

Baby, I can't talk right now.
Call me back later.

No. Wait, I can't call you back. Wait.

Yes.

Yes, I'd have to check
my records in the office.

I can't talk.

Wait.
Patricia, the DEA was just here.

The DEA. Asking questions.

What did you tell them?
To go f*ck themselves.

They want Guillermo, not you.

Can't talk. Discuss it later.
That's her.

They talked about reward.

So, she used the line

in an apartment
in the north part of the city.

We need to take advantage.

Need to use the bathroom.

Work again?

Yes.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Open the window this time.

This way.

I'd offer a drink,
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.

Have a seat.

Don Orlando,
I'm here to ask for your protection.

Why?

You don't feel safe?

I did what I had to
after my husband died.

Now I'm in your home...
ready to do what I have to again.

So what is it you're offering me?

In here.

How was the drive?

It was easy.

Nice place.

Let me start by thanking you
for the meeting.

We're both busy men.
I won't waste your time.

But I'm a business man, like you.

The information you seek maybe,
maybe, maybe is in my possession.

If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

You feel me?

On the phone,
you told me you know where Pallomari is.

Correct?

Look, let me put it this way...

Patricia and I are in love.

We want to be together.

So Guillermo's a problem for me.

From what I've heard,
he's a problem for you too. Am I right?

You are correct.

So maybe we can help each other.

If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

Okay.

Okay.

Let me fix you a drink. Okay?
Sure.

By the way...
are you guys running Windows 95 yet?

Think we're going to wait for next year.

Where the f*ck is Pallomari, you f*g?

Did you hear me?

Here's the milk. Just a few
minutes and then you go to bed.

Get in your room.
Who is it? Who is it?

I don't know. Get in your room. Quickly.

Drop the g*n! Put it down!
Drop your w*apon!

It's okay.
They're the gringos.

Calm down.
Do you know them?

They came to my office.
Put the g*n down.

Close the door.

We're here to help you.

Close the door.

Okay. Okay.
Okay.

Lower your g*n. You understand?

I'd put the safety on.

Sorry.

Do you want to sit?

Okay, DEA, are we speaking English
or Spanish or...? I don't give a shit.

Colombians have a warrant
for your arrest.

I know.
And the cartel wants you d*ad.

I'm well aware of that.

The only way you survive this is if
we get you out to the United States.

Guillermo.

The United States.

We have your ledger.

You decode it for us
and you testify on what you know...

That's quite a bit.

and we make sure
that you and your family are safe.

Which place in the United States?
I'm not sure. We have a program that...

Yeah, I know. The program.

But if I'm giving up my life...

I want to know what I'm getting for it.

For instance,
which kind of house will we have?

My family requires
a certain amount of square footage.

It wasn't hard for us to find you
and it won't be hard for them.

You understand that?

This is your chance
to keep your family alive.

We will negotiate the details later.

This is the only option you have.
Do you understand that?

Yeah.
Okay.

Why don't you pack your things,
as little as possible.

No, Guillermo.
We can't leave for at least a week.

You heard them.
The company. I can't just leave.

We must go.
I need at least a week.

Okay!

Put the radio on the dash...
and your hands on the wheel.

How are you, Jorge Salcedo?

Help your kids pack,
let me talk to your wife.

Yeah.

I know about Fredy Moya.
It's none of my business.

You're right. It's not your problem.

You realize what happens
if they find you?

And your kids?

I have to say goodbye to him.

We're in love. I can't leave like that.

Mrs. Pallomari, if you stay, you die.

Understood?

I'll be honest with you.

The truth is...

I was very disappointed to hear
you were the f*cking rat.

But I still like you.

It's all good.
I'm not going to k*ll you.

David Rodriguez...

he wants to do it himself personally,
you know?

That's fine by me.

That way,
our friendship will remain intact.

Let's go.
Come on!

The jacket...
Okay, that's it. Let's go.

We're on our way down.

Salcedo, we're in the lobby now.

Are we clear?

Salcedo.

Tell them to come out.

Jorge, we clear or not?

Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.

All clear.

Copy.

All right, stay close.

Let's finish this.

Put the g*n down.

I don't want to k*ll you.

We both know that's a lie.

Get down! Get behind the car!

Over there!

What the f*ck happened?

He has the keys.

Let's move!
Come on, get in the car!

Let's go!

Drive.
Patricia!

Don't look!
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!

Don't look! Don't look at that!

What the f*ck is he doing here?

He saved your life!
Get in the f*cking car!

Open! Open!

Be careful, be careful. Okay.

Move, move, move!

What happened? Huh?

They k*ll Navegante.

And Pallomari?

The f*ck's gone.

You sure?

We're going to the airport.
We're going to catch those...

We're leaving, now!

f*ck!

You, come with me.

We're going to the airport.
Take the guys. Now, now, now!

That's the North Valley, f*ck.

Who do they think they're messing with?

You just got smoked, bitches.

Boss!

Boss!

Let's go. Out.

Could you open, please?
Yes.

There you go.
Thank you.

Patricia, get out this way.
Careful, my love.

Okay.

What's this?

You're wanted by the CNP.

We can't aid the escape of a fugitive,
so you've gotta fly yourself out.

Do you see that?
We have a private plane.

We have a plane just for us.

If you could sign here, sir?

Me? Okay.

Yeah.

You have to pay for the plane.
Whatever you have on you.

I don't carry that kind of cash.

It's just a technicality.
So that it's not kidnapping.

Just a moment.

If it's just a technicality...

Thanks.

Okay.
Okay.

Get on the plane. Go.
Everything is going to be fine.

Come on. Let's go.

Goodbye, Salcedo.

Ladies and gentlemen, my next
witness has direct, first-hand knowledge

of the criminal activities
uncovered by Operation Cornerstone.

Please state your name, sir.

Guillermo Pallomari.

And you were an accountant
for the Cali cartel?

No, I was the chief accountant.
The chief.

El jefe.

Guillermo Pallomari had a lot to say.

And he said it in federal courtrooms
from Miami to New York City.

This is the ledger of Mr. Pallomaro
that only he himself can interpret.

I'm sorry, Your Honor, my English is not
quite good, but his Spanish is awful.

Can you repeat my name?
""Pallomari."" It's so simple.

And people were
interested in what he had to say,

especially about the cartel's influence
with the Colombian government.

So that government
went on the defensive.

And we have total agreement
in that these testimonies

that we have heard from Mr. Pallomari
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.

Thank you very much.
The damage was done.

It would be most helpful if the Colombian
president, who's head of the government

was as dedicated to fighting narcotics
tr*ffick as many of the people

in his own government.

The U.S. House and Senate began
making noise about decertification,

turning Colombia from an ally
in The w*r on Drugs into an enemy,

thr*at to choke off
the vital foreign aid

that served the shadowy interests
of both nations.

And that scared people.

Enough to see justice finally done?

Well, governments don't work that way.

Know how many times I've gotten a call

from the Department of Justice
and State the same morning?

Count 'em on one finger.

Guess we have you to thank for that.

I'm headed over
to the National Palace right now,

to make clear to President Samper
himself that the godfathers stay in jail.

At least for the foreseeable future.
But that's as far as it goes?

We drew up a draft indictment outlining

President Samper's ties
to the Cali cartel.

Alleged ties.

And I suggest you keep that draft
to yourself.

The DOJ's not going to topple
a government, Agent Pena.

You can't tell me
you're surprised by that.

Some part of me was holding out hope,
I guess.

Well, you should tell that part
to grow the f*ck up.

No, I mean it, Agent Pena.
You should be happy.

You played the system
like a g*dd*mn fiddle.

You won.

Yes, sir.

Another deal.

A compromise.

A charade.

A way for governments
who don't give a shit

about the w*r they're supposed
to be fighting...

to go on pretending they're winning it.

But it can't be won.

It'll never be won.

At least not until people see it
for what it is.

Not until they know the truth.

You know what it means
if you go on the record, right?

There'll be a price to pay.

Press the button.

Let's start with your
name and occupation.

Javier Pena, DEA attachie in Colombia.

And so the truth got out.

The news that the Cali cartel had
donated to the president's campaign...

in exchange for virtual immunity...

turned Colombia upside down.

And when the highest-ranking DEA agent
in the country went on the record

and said not only did
the United States know about it,

but we allowed it to happen...

they couldn't hide from it anymore.

An exclusive interview.

He accuses the country
of being a Narco-Democracy.

He said the country
has fallen into the abyss.

His words have not been well received
by the Colombian people.

The public is demanding
an official response from...

You didn't really call
the country that we're guests in

a ""Narco-Democracy.""

Are you saying it isn't?

The State Department's livid.
Good.

They're responsible. We all are.

Samper is not going anywhere.

Well, at least people know the truth.

I want you gone, Pena.
So do the Colombians.

I understand, sir.

You know... any aspirations
you had for your career...

just got dragged behind
the barn and sh*t.

I resigned from the DEA this morning.

Recordings that link the president

with narcotrafficking have been leaked.

The reality is they need five million.

Uh-huh.
We're missing three, see?

We have it.
Yes?

Yes, that's done.

This scandal thr*at elected president
Ernesto Samper's career

if the authorities confirm his campaign
was funded by narcotrafficking money.

President Samper,
the only solution is your resignation!

Colombians can be certain...

that if they prove
any money transfer of any kind,

the deposit would've been made
behind my back.

The Colombians
called the scandal ""Proceso 8000.""

And it set into motion
a series of events...

that finally brought the reign
of the Cali godfathers to an end.

Chepe Santacruz
never did make it back to New York.

Without the government's guarantee
that their sentences would be minimal...

Chepe decided that prison
wasn't the best place for him to be.

And so... he released himself...

and set out in search of new alliances,

with partners who could help him
rebuild the empire.

You won't believe who he chose.

Don Chepe.

I was happy to get your call.

Predictably,
it wasn't much of a partnership.

It seems the Castanos expected
a larger contribution to their cause...

than Chepe was comfortable making.

So the alliance died quickly.

And Chepe Santacruz's wild ride...
came to an end.

Pacho Herrera didn't fare much better
staying in jail.

Vendettas in the drug game never end.

And Pacho's w*r on the Salazars...

made him some lifelong
North Valley enemies.

f*ck!

And as for
the Rodriguez-Orejuela brothers,

political pressure from the U.S.,
and a disgraced Colombian president

who needed to prove
he was tough on narcos...

brought back the only effective w*apon
we have in The w*r on Drugs: extradition.

All out of favors
and unlikely to find more,

they will spend the rest of their lives
in a U.S. prison.

The good guys didn't do much better.

BETRAYAL PAYS

Back in Colombia, Jorge Salcedo
was publicly branded a rat.

The danger that he put himself in to
ensure the success of our operation...

And in the States, despite testimony

that he was instrumental to our efforts to
capture and prosecute the Cali godfathers,

he still had to plead guilty
to felony conspiracy charges.

And from there, Jorge Salcedo...

the guy who had the most to do
with bringing down the Cali cartel...

disappeared into the Federal
Witness Protection Program...

somewhere in the U.S.

A prison of its own.

You knew him, right?

Agent Camarena?

Of him.
My first assignment out of the academy

was a task force that searched for him
in Guadalajara.

It all started there.

Before him,
we didn't even know we were in a w*r.

Another hot one down there for you, huh?

You took down the big
players in Colombia.

Yeah, well... we'll make new ones.

Don't turn a victory into a defeat,
Javier.

The Colombian super-cartels are gone.

And whoever comes next are gonna be
fighting amongst themselves for years.

They're still only going to be a shadow
of what Medelli?n and Cali were.

And now it's time to take the fight
to the real enemy in The w*r on Drugs.

Mexico.

""The real enemy""?

Let me put in some calls.

I'll make
this bullshit resignation go away.

What else is a guy like you gonna do?

All right, fellas. Let's move.
Keep going.

Keep going.

You helping me with this or not?

I thought I was getting a partner.

Come on, Pop. Give me that.

Stubborn.

Stand here for an hour
and you'll count 20 of 'em going by.

So...

do you have to fix the fence
every time a storm hits?

Someone has to do it.

That's how life works.

You thinking of taking them up on it?

Mexico.

It's different there.

Son, let me tell you...
Dad.

I've done enough.

I'm through.

Hand me that cutter."

He's beating the shit<br/>

What do you want me to say?<br/>
<br/>
- Miguel's surprised us, brother.<br/>
- [GILBERTO] Look, Pacho,<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud too of how my brother's<br/>
handled things while I'm gone,<br/>
<br/>
but we all have limitations.<br/>
<br/>
I led our organization for 20 years,<br/>
always taking care of all of you.<br/>
<br/>
[PACHO] I know.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing is, I don't think<br/>
I'm ready to surrender, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I still have to find the<br/>
Salazars and resolve the situation.<br/>
<br/>
[GILBERTO] I understand, Pacho.<br/>
But you need to keep a cool head.<br/>

For now, we need to focus<br/>

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] It's a f*cking leak.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in the Colombian government<br/>
is telling them everything.<br/>
<br/>
- Your CI told you this?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it adds up.<br/>
<br/>
Our most important witness gets k*ll<br/>
right before I get him to talk.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, Botero knew that Franklin<br/>
Jurado was my only play.<br/>
<br/>
The Minister of Defense?<br/>
<br/>
- Your CI said that he was the leak?<br/>
- That we had one.<br/>
<br/>
- Then I'd keep that to yourself.<br/>
- Sir...<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, Agent Peña, you've got<br/>
nothing outside of scorched earth.<br/>
<br/>
A d*ad witness,<br/>
<br/>
a cartel w*r, and whatever the<br/>
f*ck that was in the jungle.<br/>
<br/>
We have to turn this over<br/>
to Colombian authorities.<br/>
<br/>
I told Botero that he will have<br/>
your case files by 5:00 p.m. today.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, what if Botero is the leak?<br/>
<br/>
Then we're handing it over to the<br/>
guy who works for the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, our CI, he's done everything<br/>
we've asked him to do. He's... He's...<br/>
<br/>
He risked his life.<br/>
He's risked his family.<br/>
<br/>
- We'd be hanging him out to dry.<br/>
- So get him out now.<br/>
<br/>
I'll authorize the paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
I can have the Marines at<br/>
his doorstep in 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
No. We do that... Miguel<br/>
disappears and then we're done.<br/>
<br/>
You're already done.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you said I had until 5:00 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS] What's more<br/>
important, Agent Peña?<br/>
<br/>
Getting Miguel Rodríguez...<br/>
or your CI's life?<br/>
<br/>
Crosby's handing it over<br/>
to the Colombians today.<br/>
<br/>
Any move we make,<br/>
we risk the leak finding out.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking us and Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
What did Salcedo say<br/>
about the new location?<br/>
<br/>
David stepped up security.<br/>
<br/>
It would take a battalion<br/>
of cops to get Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
He says our best bet's to<br/>
wait for Miguel to move.<br/>
<br/>
Which we don't have time for.<br/>
<br/>
So we don't wait.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, maybe we should cut our<br/>
losses, get Salcedo out now.<br/>
<br/>
Crosby won't go for it. I asked.<br/>
<br/>
Guy's risked his life for us.<br/>
His wife and kids, for f*ck's sake.<br/>
<br/>
So it's up to us to help them.<br/>
<br/>
We get Miguel, we get them out.<br/>
<br/>
Call Salcedo again.<br/>
<br/>
We take Miguel today.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] General, Miguel<br/>
Rodríguez is on the 7th floor.<br/>
<br/>
His son, David, doubled<br/>
security after the raid,<br/>
<br/>
and, well, there's no way<br/>
to get inside that building<br/>
<br/>
without attracting attention.<br/>
<br/>
We have to get Miguel to move.<br/>
<br/>
And we capture him while they're moving.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
How?<br/>
<br/>
Leave that to me.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stay here in Bogotá.<br/>
You coordinate the operation in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
But it has to be today.<br/>
<br/>
There's no time.<br/>
<br/>
Today.<br/>
<br/>
[OFFICERS MARCHING AT A DISTANCE]<br/>
<br/>
Agent Peña, after our last operation,<br/>
my superior came to see me.<br/>
<br/>
He was very diplomatic,<br/>
<br/>
but he made sure to remind<br/>
me of all I've achieved.<br/>
<br/>
[DRILL SERGEANT WHISTLING]<br/>
<br/>
And that it could all be taken away.<br/>
<br/>
What worries me is the only people<br/>
<br/>
who could do more damage to<br/>
the country than the cartel,<br/>
<br/>
are the sons of bitches they've bought.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't want to risk<br/>
bringing Miguel Rodríguez<br/>
<br/>
to jail through the front door<br/>
<br/>
so they can let him out<br/>
the back, you understand?<br/>
<br/>
General...<br/>
<br/>
you put him in jail and I'll<br/>
make sure he stays there.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Let's do it.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope the bastard enjoys<br/>
his last day of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
[PEÑA IN ENGLISH] In law<br/>
enforcement, your only real power<br/>
<br/>
comes from the strength of the<br/>
system that you represent.<br/>
<br/>
You gotta believe it has your back.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes... sometimes it doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it's so compromised,<br/>
so corrupt, that you can't trust it.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do then,<br/>
when it tries to play you?<br/>
<br/>
You look for a way to<br/>
play it right back.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] All right, gentlemen,<br/>
Miguel is here in his apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Protected by a small army.<br/>
<br/>
Once I get the signal, I'll organize<br/>
a convoy and come down this way.<br/>
<br/>
Carrera 15, until we get here.<br/>
<br/>
There we will turn and go down<br/>
25th Street until Santa Rita.<br/>
<br/>
How many cars?<br/>
<br/>
Four SUVs. I'll be in the first<br/>
and Miguel will be in the third.<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] We set up<br/>
roadblocks, close him in.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] I think that gives<br/>
him an opportunity to escape.<br/>
<br/>
I've got something far<br/>
more aggressive in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to give that son of a<br/>
bitch opportunity to end up anywhere<br/>
<br/>
other than the back of my truck.<br/>

is that he's a f*cking<br/>

we stay clear until we have Miguel,<br/>
<br/>
and then we go in for<br/>
your wife and kids.<br/>
<br/>
Are you gonna keep your word?<br/>
<br/>
We'll keep our word.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what happened, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
All right. Hey, listen...<br/>
just use this to reach us.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, she has her<br/>
first soccer practice tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
She's afraid they're gonna<br/>
make her play goalie.<br/>

<br/>
You can do this.<br/>
<br/>
I'll leave it here.<br/>
<br/>
I can do this.<br/>
<br/>
It's my only choice.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the DEA gets here,<br/>
you go with them. You can't wait for me.<br/>
<br/>
What about you?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.<br/>
<br/>
[MIGUEL] What I'm about to<br/>
tell you is a little delicate.<br/>
<br/>
But it concerns all of our futures.<br/>
<br/>
I've been concerned about<br/>
my brother, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, he's been speaking<br/>
to some of our partners<br/>
<br/>
without telling me.<br/>
<br/>
Undermining me.<br/>
<br/>
Making it very difficult<br/>
to run this business.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
I decided to have my<br/>
brother's phone tapped.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck are you saying, Miguel?<br/>
<br/>
We don't tap each other's phones.<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, it was necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I heard you two talking to<br/>
him about the surrender.<br/>
<br/>
You heard something I<br/>
wasn't supposed to say?<br/>
<br/>
[CHEPE] What is this shit, Miguel?<br/>
<br/>
Now we can't talk to Gilberto?<br/>
<br/>
Of course you can.<br/>
<br/>
You're not going to make<br/>
a f*cking speech now.<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm not going to make a speech,<br/>
<br/>
but I will tell you one important thing.<br/>
<br/>
The surrender was Gilberto's<br/>
dream. It was never ours.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, we all know how good<br/>
Gilberto is at promising things<br/>
<br/>
when he wants something from us.<br/>
<br/>
What did he promise you?<br/>
<br/>
New York.<br/>
<br/>
But did he tell you when? How?<br/>
<br/>
You have shit.<br/>
<br/>
Chepe...<br/>
<br/>
here you have a passport,<br/>
a new social security number,<br/>
<br/>
and the addresses to<br/>
two labs in New York...<br/>
<br/>
so you can rebuild what's ours.<br/>
<br/>
And what did he promise you?<br/>
<br/>
The Salazars?<br/>
<br/>
Here's the location where<br/>
the Salazars are hiding.<br/>
<br/>
So you can avenge your brother.<br/>
<br/>
Henao gave it to me.<br/>
<br/>
So the North Valley w*r is over or what?<br/>
<br/>
That's right. In our favor.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, first I had to send<br/>
that f*ck a little gift.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Miguel... I think you<br/>
need to tell us the truth.<br/>
<br/>
No f*cking lies.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck have you done with<br/>
the real Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela?<br/>
<br/>

One more thing, Minister.<br/>
It almost slipped my mind.<br/>
<br/>
What's that?<br/>
<br/>
I received some information regarding<br/>
Miguel Rodríguez's hideout.<br/>
<br/>
It seems he's in a building in Cali.<br/>
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.<br/>
<br/>
Well done, Agent. Well done.<br/>
<br/>
I'll get this information<br/>
to my men right away.<br/>
<br/>
No, that won't be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I've already got my men there<br/>

Excuse me?<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] Well,<br/>
we can't waste any time.<br/>
<br/>
You want to catch him, don't you?<br/>
<br/>
Of course I do.<br/>

This is the best option.<br/>

If we do get him,<br/>
you get the credit. I promise.<br/>

<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
... is working with the Cali cartel.<br/>

- Played a little ""telephone.""<br/>
<br/>

Have you thought about the possibility<br/>
that Salcedo is telling the truth?<br/>
<br/>
Just because you don't like him<br/>
<br/>
doesn't mean everything<br/>
he says is bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
That's got nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
There's plenty of people I don't<br/>
like but still trust. Like you.<br/>
<br/>
Darío. You see that camera?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it caught something. Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
I found this one from last week.<br/>
<br/>
[DAVID] Play it.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward.<br/>
<br/>
Faster.<br/>
<br/>

Hit play.<br/>

And stop... stop it there.<br/>

See? These f*ck<br/>
must be the DEA, right?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Keep going.<br/>

Just waiting for Miguel to come down.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] Despite how<br/>
difficult this week has been,<br/>
<br/>
we're making it out of the storm.<br/>
<br/>
[JORGE] It would seem so, sir.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about<br/>
the promise I made to you.<br/>
<br/>
Six months... until you open<br/>
your security business.<br/>
<br/>
That's right, sir.<br/>
<br/>
It's even possible that I'll<br/>
invest in your business.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about that?<br/>
<br/>
It would be an honor<br/>
to have your support.<br/>
<br/>
Can I help you with your bag?<br/>
<br/>
No, this is almost ready.<br/>
<br/>
Take those. I'll see you downstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Keep going.<br/>
- [WHIRRING]<br/>
<br/>
Stop it there.<br/>
<br/>
No, that's Enrique. Keep going.<br/>
<br/>
Open it.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] Salcedo is downstairs.<br/>
We're waiting for Miguel.<br/>

Stop. Go back.<br/>

<br/>
It's him.<br/>
<br/>
It's that bastard, Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
David, again with this bullshit?<br/>
When will you stop?<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
I found the DEA hideout. The one<br/>
Enrique told us Salcedo knew about.<br/>
<br/>
And on the same street,<br/>
there's a hotel with a camera<br/>
<br/>
pointed towards the street.<br/>
<br/>
We checked the video with Darío,<br/>
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,<br/>
<br/>
and that f*ck Salcedo, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure about that?<br/>
<br/>
One hundred percent.<br/>
I checked the plates.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, think about it.<br/>
<br/>
He's trying to take you<br/>
out of a safe place<br/>
<br/>
so they can catch you in the open.<br/>
<br/>
It's a trap, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Dad...<br/>
<br/>
I'll call you back.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge. Don Miguel asked me to tell you<br/>
<br/>
that he needs your help with<br/>
something before we leave.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] f*ck.<br/>
They just called him back inside.<br/>

<br/>
We stick to the plan.<br/>
When Miguel moves, we get him.<br/>
<br/>
They're gonna k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, he might already be d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
All due respect, sir, we have to go in.<br/>

Got a minute?<br/>
<br/>
- We were wrong.<br/>
- Wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I checked the Samper<br/>
campaign financials<br/>
<br/>
and I found that in July of last year,<br/>
they had serious losses.<br/>
<br/>
They needed money for travel,<br/>
ads, etcetera.<br/>
<br/>
And they got $6 million.<br/>
<br/>
Just happens to be the amount<br/>
Botero took from the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
- he wasn't laundering the money.<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
That money stayed in the campaign.<br/>
<br/>
It was a contribution.<br/>
<br/>
[DOOR OPENS]<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] I need a word.<br/>
<br/>
Right away.<br/>
<br/>
- Have a seat.<br/>
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on?<br/>
- We got Miguel Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
You got him?<br/>
<br/>
He's on a plane back<br/>
to Bogotá right now.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be all over the news in an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Couldn't let it go, could you?<br/>
<br/>
Sir, there's another piece of<br/>
this that you need to know.<br/>
<br/>
These are bank accounts opened in<br/>
Curaçao by a guy named Medina.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know him.<br/>
<br/>
Well, good, because he was<br/>
working with Fernando Botero.<br/>
<br/>
They received over six million<br/>
dollars from the Cali cartel,<br/>
<br/>
which went into the Samper<br/>
presidential campaign.<br/>
<br/>
And you know this how?<br/>
<br/>
I did some digging.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, I am certain that the<br/>
Minister of Defense is corrupt<br/>
<br/>
and that it doesn't stop there.<br/>
<br/>
You ask the president, he's gonna<br/>
say he didn't have a f*cking clue,<br/>
<br/>
but that money won him the election.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto, Miguel,<br/>
they walk right out of prison<br/>
<br/>
unless these f*cking politicians<br/>
are in there with them.<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS]<br/>
<br/>
The voice you're about to hear<br/>
<br/>
is the voice of the man you just<br/>
mentioned, Santiago Medina...<br/>
<br/>
talking to Gilberto Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
On the phone.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] We've been<br/>
talking, Mr. Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of interest on our part.<br/>
<br/>
If there's interest on your end...<br/>
<br/>
[GILBERTO] Yes. Of course there is.<br/>
<br/>
We would need to know<br/>
<br/>
what we would be getting<br/>
for our contribution.<br/>
<br/>
[MEDINA] Of course.<br/>
<br/>
As you know, our goal is to reward<br/>
our supporters once we take office.<br/>
<br/>
The terms we discussed<br/>
are certainly reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
[GILBERTO] Then you have our support.<br/>
<br/>
How would we organize the payments?<br/>
<br/>
We should get together and discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] How long have you known?<br/>
<br/>
It's complicated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The point, Agent Peña, is you're right.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case...<br/>
<br/>
it doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
You're not gonna do anything.<br/>
<br/>
Samper's a good friend to us.<br/>
<br/>
So that's it.<br/>
<br/>
They bought...<br/>
<br/>

the president.<br/>

Please, Mr. Santacruz.<br/>
You have to come with us.<br/>

Here's how this is gonna go.<br/>

<br/>
it's complicated.<br/>
<br/>
How about, uh... I tried to warn you?<br/>
<br/>
[SCOFFS]<br/>
<br/>
Like you've never cut a corner<br/>
to get to the front of the line?<br/>
<br/>
Question is... what you<br/>
do when you get there.<br/>
<br/>
There's always gonna be new<br/>
bad guys to fight, Agent Peña.<br/>
<br/>
We make new ones every day.<br/>
<br/>
But... any way you slice it...<br/>
<br/>
you're the agent that put<br/>

No small feat.<br/>

[SONG ENDS]</div>]","[IN SPANISH] Sir?

The telephone recordings you
requested. From La Picota.

Excuse me.

[PACHO] He k*ll the DEA rat.

He's beating the shit
out of the North Valley.

What do you want me to say?

- Miguel's surprised us, brother.
- [GILBERTO] Look, Pacho,

I'm proud too of how my brother's
handled things while I'm gone,

but we all have limitations.

I led our organization for 20 years,
always taking care of all of you.

[PACHO] I know.

But the thing is, I don't think
I'm ready to surrender, Gilberto.

Besides, I still have to find the
Salazars and resolve the situation.

[GILBERTO] I understand, Pacho.
But you need to keep a cool head.

For now, we need to focus
on the surrender plans.

[HENAO] A f*cking fridge?

A message from Miguel
Rodríguez Orejuela.

[FLIES BUZZING]

Son of a bitch! What's that smell?

The surveillance team we sent to Cali.

Call me

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

[IN ENGLISH] It's a f*cking leak.

Someone in the Colombian government
is telling them everything.

- Your CI told you this?
- Yeah.

I mean, it adds up.

Our most important witness gets k*ll
right before I get him to talk.

Sir, Botero knew that Franklin
Jurado was my only play.

The Minister of Defense?

- Your CI said that he was the leak?
- That we had one.

- Then I'd keep that to yourself.
- Sir...

The fact is, Agent Peña, you've got
nothing outside of scorched earth.

A d*ad witness,

a cartel w*r, and whatever the
f*ck that was in the jungle.

We have to turn this over
to Colombian authorities.

I told Botero that he will have
your case files by 5:00 p.m. today.

Sir, what if Botero is the leak?

Then we're handing it over to the
guy who works for the cartel.

Ambassador, our CI, he's done everything
we've asked him to do. He's... He's...

He risked his life.
He's risked his family.

- We'd be hanging him out to dry.
- So get him out now.

I'll authorize the paperwork.

I can have the Marines at
his doorstep in 20 minutes.

No. We do that... Miguel
disappears and then we're done.

You're already done.

I thought you said I had until 5:00 p.m.

[SIGHS] What's more
important, Agent Peña?

Getting Miguel Rodríguez...
or your CI's life?

Crosby's handing it over
to the Colombians today.

Any move we make,
we risk the leak finding out.

f*cking us and Salcedo.

What did Salcedo say
about the new location?

David stepped up security.

It would take a battalion
of cops to get Miguel.

He says our best bet's to
wait for Miguel to move.

Which we don't have time for.

So we don't wait.

Sir, maybe we should cut our
losses, get Salcedo out now.

Crosby won't go for it. I asked.

Guy's risked his life for us.
His wife and kids, for f*ck's sake.

So it's up to us to help them.

We get Miguel, we get them out.

Call Salcedo again.

We take Miguel today.

[IN SPANISH] General, Miguel
Rodríguez is on the 7th floor.

His son, David, doubled
security after the raid,

and, well, there's no way
to get inside that building

without attracting attention.

We have to get Miguel to move.

And we capture him while they're moving.

Exactly.

How?

Leave that to me.

I'll stay here in Bogotá.
You coordinate the operation in Cali.

But it has to be today.

There's no time.

Today.

[OFFICERS MARCHING AT A DISTANCE]

Agent Peña, after our last operation,
my superior came to see me.

He was very diplomatic,

but he made sure to remind
me of all I've achieved.

[DRILL SERGEANT WHISTLING]

And that it could all be taken away.

What worries me is the only people

who could do more damage to
the country than the cartel,

are the sons of bitches they've bought.

And I don't want to risk
bringing Miguel Rodríguez

to jail through the front door

so they can let him out
the back, you understand?

General...

you put him in jail and I'll
make sure he stays there.

All right.

Let's do it.

Let's hope the bastard enjoys
his last day of freedom.

[PEÑA IN ENGLISH] In law
enforcement, your only real power

comes from the strength of the
system that you represent.

You gotta believe it has your back.

But sometimes... sometimes it doesn't.

Sometimes it's so compromised,
so corrupt, that you can't trust it.

What do you do then,
when it tries to play you?

You look for a way to
play it right back.

[IN SPANISH] All right, gentlemen,
Miguel is here in his apartment.

Protected by a small army.

Once I get the signal, I'll organize
a convoy and come down this way.

Carrera 15, until we get here.

There we will turn and go down
25th Street until Santa Rita.

How many cars?

Four SUVs. I'll be in the first
and Miguel will be in the third.

[IN ENGLISH] We set up
roadblocks, close him in.

[IN SPANISH] I think that gives
him an opportunity to escape.

I've got something far
more aggressive in mind.

I don't want to give that son of a
bitch opportunity to end up anywhere

other than the back of my truck.

You flush him out of the apartment,
and I'll take him down.

[ENRIQUE ON RECORDING] Sir,
please believe me!

I swear it on my family, sir.

No! No, sir! Please wait!

I already told you the truth, sir!

[CLICKS]

Play it again. From the beginning.

But what for?

All you're going to hear is a man
yelling because he's being tortured,

nothing more.

I told you,

maybe he said something that will
help us nail the f*ck.

But didn't we already catch the mole?

I'm going to tell you something.

I hate that f*ck
Salcedo with all of my heart.

But what's your problem
with him? He may be clean.

The problem I have with him

is that he's a f*cking
lying son of a bitch.

And I know it.

Now start it from the f*cking beginning.

You hear?

[IN ENGLISH] For this to work,
I have to leave my family again.

- Okay, we'll get them out. Don't worry.
- They're watching my house.

All right, so we wait,
we stay clear until we have Miguel,

and then we go in for
your wife and kids.

Are you gonna keep your word?

We'll keep our word.

Hey, what happened, Jorge?

All right. Hey, listen...
just use this to reach us.

My oldest daughter, she has her
first soccer practice tomorrow.

She's afraid they're gonna
make her play goalie.

I don't know what to tell her.

Hey, we're gonna get him, Jorge.

[ENGINE STARTS]

[IN SPANISH] Put the clothes
you want to take on the bed.

Put any jewelry and
valuables under the clothes.

Anyone comes in, it will look
like you just did the wash.

When it's time, put everything
in the suitcases, okay?

Good. One more thing.

Come with me, please.

Paola, don't freak out.

- Wait, Jorge, wait.
- It's only a precaution, Paola.

Wow.

My love.

Eh...

Take it, Paola.

Like this. Hold on tight.

Here's the safety. Now it's ready...

- [g*n CLICKS]
- And now it's not.

That's the only thing you need to do.

If anyone you don't know comes
through that door, use it.

[GULPS]

- Okay?
- Yes.

My love, you can do this.

You can do this.

I'll leave it here.

I can do this.

It's my only choice.

As soon as the DEA gets here,
you go with them. You can't wait for me.

What about you?

I'll be fine.

Don't worry.

Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

[MIGUEL] What I'm about to
tell you is a little delicate.

But it concerns all of our futures.

I've been concerned about
my brother, Gilberto.

The thing is, he's been speaking
to some of our partners

without telling me.

Undermining me.

Making it very difficult
to run this business.

So...

I decided to have my
brother's phone tapped.

What the f*ck are you saying, Miguel?

We don't tap each other's phones.

I know.

But in this case, it was necessary.

I heard you two talking to
him about the surrender.

You heard something I
wasn't supposed to say?

[CHEPE] What is this shit, Miguel?

Now we can't talk to Gilberto?

Of course you can.

You're not going to make
a f*cking speech now.

No, I'm not going to make a speech,

but I will tell you one important thing.

The surrender was Gilberto's
dream. It was never ours.

Besides, we all know how good
Gilberto is at promising things

when he wants something from us.

What did he promise you?

New York.

But did he tell you when? How?

You have shit.

Chepe...

here you have a passport,
a new social security number,

and the addresses to
two labs in New York...

so you can rebuild what's ours.

And what did he promise you?

The Salazars?

Here's the location where
the Salazars are hiding.

So you can avenge your brother.

Henao gave it to me.

So the North Valley w*r is over or what?

That's right. In our favor.

Of course, first I had to send
that f*ck a little gift.

Look, Miguel... I think you
need to tell us the truth.

No f*cking lies.

What the f*ck have you done with
the real Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela?

[CHEPE LAUGHS]

Surrender's for pussies.

[CHUCKLING]

[BREATHES DEEPLY]

[TSKING]

Listen up... Mr. Wiretap.

Never ever touch my phone.

Understood?

Don Miguel.

Sir.

- What?
- Excuse me.

I just heard DEA agents
are back in Cali.

[INHALES, CLEARS THROAT]

Any update on the accountant?

Well, we're still looking, but no luck.

[DAVID] f*ck.

This has to be the place
Enrique told us about.

[CAR HORN HONKING]

[CLATTERING]

Look there.

See if you can find
anything about Salcedo.

f*ck.

[BOTERO] I know this isn't the
ideal situation for your team,

but I appreciate cooperation
with the transition.

Of course.

I'll put you in touch with the police
investigative team I've assigned.

I'll give you the phone number.

And they'll stop by for
the files this afternoon.

Thank you.

One more thing, Minister.
It almost slipped my mind.

What's that?

I received some information regarding
Miguel Rodríguez's hideout.

It seems he's in a building in Cali.
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.

Well done, Agent. Well done.

I'll get this information
to my men right away.

No, that won't be necessary.

I've already got my men there
preparing for the raid today.

Excuse me?

[IN ENGLISH] Well,
we can't waste any time.

You want to catch him, don't you?

Of course I do.

This is the best option.

If we do get him,
you get the credit. I promise.

Thank you, sir.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

[FERCHO] Jorge?

[IN SPANISH] Don Miguel
wants to see you right away.

Coming.

Sir.

Just got off the phone
with our friend in Bogotá.

Seems those DEA agents
are here for a reason.

He says they're planning a raid.

We can take you to Santa Rita.

- Do it.
- Of course, sir.

[PHONE DIALING ON SPEED DIAL]

We got some news.

Get the cars ready.

[CLOSES FLIP PHONE]

[BEEPING]

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Peña.

[FEISTL IN ENGLISH] Your message
went through. Botero's the leak.

Miguel's on the move.

Good. Keep me posted on stage two.

Copy that.

[BEEPS]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

[IN SPANISH] Good morning.

Hello.

[CHUCKLES] You seem happy.

Defense Minister Fernando Botero...

Mm-hmm.

... is working with the Cali cartel.

- What makes you so sure?
- Played a little ""telephone.""

Something I said to him that only
I know was repeated in Cali.

[SCOFFS]

Normally, I'd say you're crazy, but...

I'm going to show you something.

- Those Curaçao bank files you gave me.
- Yes.

I had a bank source help
me dig through them.

And?

What's interesting is who's listed
alongside Franklin Jurado's name

on this account.

Santiago Medina. Who's he?

He's an art collector.

But rumor is he does some money
laundering for upper class Colombians.

Cleans their cash through fancy
charities, dummy corporations,

campaign contributions.

Guess who

Santiago Medina worked with on
the last presidential campaign?

Fernando Botero.

[DAVID] There's nothing.

Have you thought about the possibility
that Salcedo is telling the truth?

Just because you don't like him

doesn't mean everything
he says is bullshit.

That's got nothing to do with it.

There's plenty of people I don't
like but still trust. Like you.

Darío. You see that camera?

Maybe it caught something. Huh?

Come on.

I found this one from last week.

[DAVID] Play it.

Fast forward.

Faster.

[WHIRRING]

Hit play.

And stop... stop it there.

See? These f*ck
must be the DEA, right?

Mm-hmm.

Keep going.

[IN SPANISH] His transport arrived.

We're in position.

I'll let you know when they come out.

[BEEPING]

[PHONE RINGS]

[IN ENGLISH] Where are we?

[FEISTL] Serrano's in position.
Just waiting for Miguel to come down.

[IN SPANISH] Despite how
difficult this week has been,

we're making it out of the storm.

[JORGE] It would seem so, sir.

I've been thinking about
the promise I made to you.

Six months... until you open
your security business.

That's right, sir.

It's even possible that I'll
invest in your business.

What do you think about that?

It would be an honor
to have your support.

Can I help you with your bag?

No, this is almost ready.

Take those. I'll see you downstairs.

Of course, sir.

- Keep going.
- [WHIRRING]

Stop it there.

No, that's Enrique. Keep going.

Open it.

[IN SPANISH] Salcedo is downstairs.
We're waiting for Miguel.

[SERRANO] Copy that.

Stop. Go back.

Go back.

More.

There.

- Isn't that Enrique again?
- Can you get this shit to stop shaking?

Man...

Man, you were right.

You were right, man.

I'm going to k*ll that f*ck.

Take this.

Careful with this.

[PHONE RINGING]

[AUDIO PLAYING IN HEADPHONES]

f*ck, he's not answering.

[RINGING CONTINUES]

Here.

Thank you.

[BEEPS]

- Hello.
- [DAVID] Dad.

It's him.

It's that bastard, Salcedo.

David, again with this bullshit?
When will you stop?

Listen to me.

I found the DEA hideout. The one
Enrique told us Salcedo knew about.

And on the same street,
there's a hotel with a camera

pointed towards the street.

We checked the video with Darío,
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,

and that f*ck Salcedo, Dad.

Are you sure about that?

One hundred percent.
I checked the plates.

Dad, think about it.

He's trying to take you
out of a safe place

so they can catch you in the open.

It's a trap, Dad.

Dad...

I'll call you back.

Jorge. Don Miguel asked me to tell you

that he needs your help with
something before we leave.

Jorge?

Yes.

[IN ENGLISH] f*ck.
They just called him back inside.

[TIRES SCREECHING]

Shit.

David Rodríguez just showed
up at the Salcedos'.

NO SERVICE

They know.

- [PEÑA] Are you sure?
- Has to be.

They called him back inside.
David's at the Salcedos'...

- Just wait, wait.
- [FEISTL] We have to go in and get him.

We stick to the plan.
When Miguel moves, we get him.

They're gonna k*ll him.

Yeah, well, he might already be d*ad.

All due respect, sir, we have to go in.

All right, go.

[BEEPS]

[IN SPANISH] Tell
Serrano we're going in.

- Let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

[SOLDIER] General!

We have to go in now! Out!

You need me, Don Miguel?

Take a seat.

All right, but we should be going.

I think we're going to
be a little safer here.

You f*cking son of a bitch!

What is this?
What's going on, Don Miguel?

[COUGHING]

[JORGE] Don Miguel!

Look how diligent! Very...

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Girls, whatever happens,
you don't leave the room, all right?

- All right.
- Don't come out for any reason.

There's two men out front.

They're here for you. Stay close.

[IN SPANISH] Let's go through the back.

[GRUNTING]

I believed you over my own son.

You took my money.

I let you protect my family.

You listened to our private
conversations, you son of a bitch.

I gave you all my trust.

And what did it mean to you? Shit.

Nothing.

You're an animal.

You're a little wharf rat.

Not even that. A rat has
more dignity than you.

Do you know what I've
just done, f*ck?

I told David to go to your house...

and k*ll your wife and
daughters, you f*ck!

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

[DAVID IN SPANISH] Mrs. Salcedo.

[IN ENGLISH] My kids.

Get to their room. Stay there. Go.

- Agent Peña.

I've got Miguel Rodríguez,
handcuffed, at my side.

And Salcedo?

[IN ENGLISH] I got them. They're safe.

[IN SPANISH] Get in.

[IN ENGLISH] Let me talk to my wife.

- Jorge.
- Jorge?

[IN SPANISH] Hello, my love.
You all right?

Yes, and you? The girls?

Yes. Yes, the girls are all right.
They're scared, but all right.

We did it, Paola.

Yes. Yes, we did it.

I'll be with you soon, my love.

[CAR ENGINE STARTS]

[DIALING]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Got a minute?

- We were wrong.
- Wrong?

Yes. I checked the Samper
campaign financials

and I found that in July of last year,
they had serious losses.

They needed money for travel,
ads, etcetera.

And they got $6 million.

Just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

So...

- he wasn't laundering the money.
- No.

That money stayed in the campaign.

It was a contribution.

[DOOR OPENS]

[IN ENGLISH] I need a word.

Right away.

- Have a seat.
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.

- What's going on?
- We got Miguel Rodríguez.

You got him?

He's on a plane back
to Bogotá right now.

It'll be all over the news in an hour.

Couldn't let it go, could you?

Sir, there's another piece of
this that you need to know.

These are bank accounts opened in
Curaçao by a guy named Medina.

Yeah, I know him.

Well, good, because he was
working with Fernando Botero.

They received over six million
dollars from the Cali cartel,

which went into the Samper
presidential campaign.

And you know this how?

I did some digging.

Ambassador, I am certain that the
Minister of Defense is corrupt

and that it doesn't stop there.

You ask the president, he's gonna
say he didn't have a f*cking clue,

but that money won him the election.

Gilberto, Miguel,
they walk right out of prison

unless these f*cking politicians
are in there with them.

[SIGHS]

The voice you're about to hear

is the voice of the man you just
mentioned, Santiago Medina...

talking to Gilberto Rodríguez.

On the phone.

[IN SPANISH] We've been
talking, Mr. Rodríguez.

There's a lot of interest on our part.

If there's interest on your end...

[GILBERTO] Yes. Of course there is.

We would need to know

what we would be getting
for our contribution.

[MEDINA] Of course.

As you know, our goal is to reward
our supporters once we take office.

The terms we discussed
are certainly reasonable.

[GILBERTO] Then you have our support.

How would we organize the payments?

We should get together and discuss it.

[IN ENGLISH] How long have you known?

It's complicated.

[SCOFFS]

The point, Agent Peña, is you're right.

But in this case...

it doesn't matter.

You're not gonna do anything.

Samper's a good friend to us.

So that's it.

They bought...

[SCOFFS]

the president.

And for now...

they get to keep him.

We never had a chance.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

[SIGHS]

[IN SPANISH] I know it's difficult.

But you get used to being here.

[CHUCKLES]

You bastard.

Look, brother...

let's put the past behind us.

I know this isn't what
you wanted to hear...

but, regardless, we are winning.

I don't know what the f*ck
we're winning, Gilberto.

By catching you, brother,
they did us a favor.

Now Pacho and Chepe have
to turn themselves in.

That's the only way we'll be
able to negotiate the terms.

Well, you better be right, because
I'm not staying in this sh*thole.

[CHUCKLES]

I heard about Miguel.

I'm going to surrender.

And Chepe too.

But before that, I have one
last thing I have to finish.

- [SIZZLING]
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]

[OFFICER WHISTLES]

Gentlemen.

Mr. Santacruz, we have to
ask you to come with us.

You're under arrest.

There's room at the bar.
Make yourself comfortable.

Please, Mr. Santacruz.
You have to come with us.

Who do you think called the police?

Here's how this is gonna go.

When I'm done...

when I'm f*cking ready...

then you can give me a ride to jail.

Take a seat.

Eat this. Come on.

Order whatever you want.

Come on.

[LAUGHS] Ah!

[IN ENGLISH] This your celebration?

Kind of a downer.

I was hoping for some alcohol.

How long have you had them?

The tapes Crosby played for me.

Let me guess. It's, uh...

it's complicated.

How about, uh... I tried to warn you?

[SCOFFS]

Like you've never cut a corner
to get to the front of the line?

Question is... what you
do when you get there.

There's always gonna be new
bad guys to fight, Agent Peña.

We make new ones every day.

But... any way you slice it...

you're the agent that put
cuffs on two Cali godfathers.

No small feat.

Go on.

You earned it.

while you and your men were there<br/>

<br/>
drilling holes, breaking furniture.<br/>
<br/>
We were one minute away<br/>

<br/>
But you did not.<br/>

I need you to hand over all intel,<br/>

be part of this operation.<br/>

- Yes, I am.<br/>
<br/>
Minister, we recovered something<br/>
from the house.<br/>
<br/>
It's a ledger.<br/>
<br/>
Cartel accounts, transactions,<br/>
going back years.<br/>
<br/>
- What is this? I don't see names.<br/>
- It's coded.<br/>
<br/>
It's bribes, money laundering...<br/>
cocaine sales.<br/>
<br/>
- Cali's whole operation.<br/>
- That's right.<br/>
<br/>
- And do you have someone who can read it?<br/>
- There are two possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
There's the cartel accountant,<br/>
Guillermo Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but he's underground. Maybe worse.<br/>
<br/>
And there's the money launderer<br/>
we extradited from Curaçao,<br/>
<br/>
Franklin Jurado.<br/>
<br/>
Jurado's the most important witness<br/>
to this case and he's in U.S. custody.<br/>

We're not handing him over<br/>
to a special prosecutor.<br/>

So you're welcome<br/>

<br/>
[in English] A get-out-of-jail-free card.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] To us, Peña.<br/>
<br/>
Enrique!<br/>
<br/>
Boss.<br/>
<br/>
Open the door. Quick.<br/>
<br/>
- Boss...<br/>
- What are you doing? Get in.<br/>
<br/>
- What happened?<br/>
- David has been calling.<br/>
<br/>
What for? He never called before.<br/>
<br/>
- I wanted to talk to you first.<br/>
- Last night was a big f*ck up.<br/>
<br/>
You're in danger.<br/>
Pack a few things and let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter, Enrique.<br/>
The DEA passed right in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
I should just run, bro.<br/>
<br/>
Like Córdova?<br/>
<br/>
What? It doesn't matter!<br/>
<br/>
Stay, run. It's the same f*cking thing!<br/>
<br/>
No matter what I do,<br/>
I'm a f*cking d*ad man.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is going to die.<br/>
<br/>
But right now,<br/>
let's just get you to tomorrow, Enrique.<br/>
<br/>
[beeping]<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Keep paging him<br/>
until he hits us back.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing else we can do.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
We should've arrested him.<br/>
<br/>
You know, brought him in for as*ault<br/>
or something to save him.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck. I hope we didn't<br/>
hang him out to dry.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you didn't like him.<br/>
<br/>
[scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, doesn't mean I want him d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Why the f*ck do I have<br/>
to hide here? I didn't do anything.<br/>
<br/>
I know you didn't do anything.<br/>
<br/>
This is David being an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
But... trust me.<br/>
Have some patience. I'll handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge...<br/>
<br/>
last week,<br/>
when you told me to not say anything...<br/>
<br/>
- about the DEA and their safe house...<br/>
- Hey.<br/>
<br/>
That has nothing to do with anything.<br/>
Why are you bringing this up?<br/>
<br/>
Stay focused.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down.<br/>
<br/>
It's very important you do what I say.<br/>
<br/>
Don't leave this room.<br/>
<br/>
And don't call anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Not your mother, your brother<br/>
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, look at me.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get you through this.<br/>
<br/>
I promise.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
- Jorge.<br/>
- Fercho, how's it going?<br/>
<br/>
Don Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Where the f*ck is Enrique, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
I left him messages at his house,<br/>
at the tap room,<br/>
<br/>
but trust me, I'll find him.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of where he is,<br/>
you know him as well as me.<br/>
<br/>
He's a man we can trust.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.<br/>
<br/>
Because I didn't hire him, you did.<br/>
<br/>
No, Córdova hired him.<br/>
But that doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like to make judgments<br/>
before I know all the facts,<br/>
<br/>
and we don't know them, David.<br/>
<br/>
I find that funny, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Because lately,<br/>
you're missing too many facts.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically,<br/>
about the f*cking DEA, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
When the DEA burst into the building,<br/>
I was six feet away from your dad.<br/>
<br/>
Don Miguel, I've been investigating<br/>
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.<br/>
<br/>
I think the DEA is using a signal<br/>
to interfere with our radios.<br/>
<br/>
Dad...<br/>
<br/>
Dad, please.<br/>
<br/>
It could be.<br/>
<br/>
It could be.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't explain how the DEA<br/>
knew where I was. Do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Someone sang and I want to know<br/>
who the f*ck it was.<br/>
<br/>
Find Enrique.<br/>
Let's have him speak for himself.<br/>
<br/>
We f*cking fix this once and for all.<br/>
<br/>
[car brakes screech]<br/>
<br/>
- Hi, fellas.<br/>
- Sir.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English]<br/>
w*r makes for strange alliances,<br/>
<br/>
putting you into business<br/>
with people that,<br/>
<br/>
under other circumstances,<br/>
you wouldn't even shake hands with.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Great machine.<br/>
<br/>
You people know how to build<br/>
a f*cking as*ault chopper.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English]<br/>
The same is true of your enemies.<br/>
<br/>
They will unite when they need to.<br/>
<br/>
FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces<br/>
of Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
were a guerrilla army<br/>
about 17,000 strong...<br/>
<br/>
engaged in the longest civil w*r<br/>
in modern history.<br/>
<br/>
And in the early days of that w*r,<br/>
how did they finance their struggle?<br/>
<br/>
Kidnapping.<br/>
<br/>
Wealthy Colombians would pay a ransom<br/>
<br/>
to have their loved ones<br/>
returned unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
So when the Cali cartel<br/>
wanted to keep someone on ice,<br/>
<br/>
safely hidden somewhere<br/>
in the middle of the jungle,<br/>
<br/>
they hired the pros.<br/>
<br/>
For a hefty fee, of course.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in Spanish] Nice look, Berna.<br/>
<br/>
You're coming on the raid?<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles] Thanks, but no.<br/>
<br/>
I'm coming to make sure<br/>
all goes well with our friends.<br/>
<br/>
Look at me.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think an important man like me...<br/>
<br/>
is going to risk his life<br/>
for some gringo piece of ass?<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
You don't know how to take a joke.<br/>
<br/>
[whirring]<br/>
<br/>
[car humming]<br/>
<br/>
I'll go in.<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
But they go with you.<br/>
<br/>
What about you, brother?<br/>
Are you trying to f*ck us all or what?<br/>
<br/>
Calm down, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want to surrender,<br/>
and you let them get the g*dd*mn ledger!<br/>
<br/>
Since you were a kid, I had to tell you<br/>
what to do and what not to...<br/>
<br/>
You know what, Gilberto?<br/>
<br/>
Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.<br/>
Why don't you just shut up?<br/>
<br/>
[beeps]<br/>
<br/>
He's f*cking lost his mind.<br/>
<br/>
All these acts of v*olence<br/>
in the North Valley<br/>
<br/>
are straining our friends' patience.<br/>
<br/>
Any surrender deal's hanging by a thread.<br/>
<br/>
Uncle Miguel has to see that.<br/>
<br/>
I told him, no v*olence.<br/>
<br/>
Is this all my fault?<br/>
<br/>
Haven't I always done<br/>
what was best for him?<br/>
<br/>
Franklin Jurado.<br/>
<br/>
I need to reach out to Chepe. Or Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
But how the f*ck...?<br/>
<br/>
There's no one else I can trust with this.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see...<br/>
<br/>
Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Nicolás...<br/>
<br/>
I need you to get involved<br/>
in the Jurado situation.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Any news?<br/>
<br/>
He has a girlfriend<br/>
on the other side of town.<br/>
<br/>
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,<br/>
he wouldn't be around anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Ah... Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll wait here.<br/>
<br/>
You know he's a mama's boy.<br/>
That f*ck will be back.<br/>
<br/>
So now what?<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Now you go to Toro n*gro.<br/>
Navegante's waiting for you.<br/>
<br/>
He'll give you<br/>
an assignment from my father.<br/>
<br/>
Why didn't he call me?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to explain something to you.<br/>
<br/>
Until this is figured out,<br/>
you only talk to me. Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Better get moving.<br/>
Navegante hates to wait.<br/>
<br/>
[rock music playing]<br/>
<br/>
[man] Coming up to coordinates Kirk 5-7,<br/>
maneuver incoming.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English] Private militias<br/>
not only weren't illegal in Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
they were encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
A government program called CONVIVIR<br/>
was started in 1994.<br/>
<br/>
And it authorized private security forces<br/>
<br/>
to take up arms<br/>
against the communist guerrillas.<br/>
<br/>
A free pass for crimes against humanity,<br/>
sponsored by Uncle Sam.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
Gentlemen. So good to see you again.<br/>
<br/>
Third generation night vision goggles.<br/>
<br/>
The same ones the Americans used<br/>
in Operation Desert Shield.<br/>
<br/>
Peña, can we keep them afterwards<br/>
as a contribution to the cause?<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English] The Castaños ran<br/>
the largest private militia in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Their AUC,<br/>
or AutodefensasUnidas de Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
numbered in the tens of thousands.<br/>
<br/>
Their victims...<br/>
in the hundreds of thousands.<br/>
<br/>
Theirs was a perpetual w*r.<br/>
<br/>
And if you're hunting communist guerrillas<br/>
in the jungle, they were your only call.<br/>
<br/>
[blasts]<br/>
<br/>
This one has AFCS.<br/>
<br/>
And the 701 engine. Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
- Not like last time.<br/>
- [Peña] Last time?<br/>
<br/>
The CIA.<br/>
<br/>
They had us out here hunting commies<br/>
on Christmas day.<br/>
<br/>
- That's real dedication.<br/>
- It is God's work.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
[David] My dad trusts him, but...<br/>
did you see him?<br/>
<br/>
[Darío] That son of a bitch<br/>
looks nervous, right?<br/>
<br/>
[David] Never stopped<br/>
adjusting the mirror, staring.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of love how much<br/>
this f*ck hates me.<br/>
<br/>
[David and Darío chuckle]<br/>
<br/>
[David] Our man in Bogotá<br/>
confirmed there must be an informant.<br/>
<br/>
[Darío] Huh?<br/>
<br/>
[David] Salcedo has to be the one<br/>
the gringos are calling ""Natalia.""<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to love<br/>
k*ll that f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
You know who else I am going to k*ll?<br/>
His arrogant wife.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to leave<br/>
those poor girls orphans.<br/>
<br/>
[Darío] Poor things.<br/>
<br/>
[David] You can adopt them.<br/>
<br/>
[laughs] You son of a bitch...<br/>

Hello, love, it's me.<br/>

It's very important.<br/>

<br/>
Take me to where you stashed him,<br/>
Jorge Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
Stashed who?<br/>
<br/>
Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
Are we taking him someplace?<br/>
<br/>
Uh-uh.<br/>
<br/>
I see.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean,<br/>
you're going to a meeting?<br/>
<br/>
I have a business to run, Guillermo.<br/>
<br/>
A meeting with who?<br/>
<br/>
With Fredy. We're meeting a new client.<br/>
<br/>
Fredy? Patricia,<br/>
the police almost caught Miguel yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
For f*ck's sake.<br/>
<br/>
What's the problem?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't tell them where he was,<br/>
did you?<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
- No. What are you worried about?<br/>
<br/>
Miguel likes you.<br/>
That's what you always tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but always within limits.<br/>
<br/>
You're worrying too much, Guillermo.<br/>
<br/>
They need you. You're the brains<br/>
behind the organization...<br/>
<br/>
None of that matters, Patricia, none,<br/>
if they decide not to leave loose ends.<br/>
<br/>
You're giving me a headache.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
My love, we have to get out of here<br/>
before it's too late.<br/>
<br/>
It's just a couple hours.<br/>
<br/>
Call me if there's a problem.<br/>
<br/>
[door opens]<br/>
<br/>
[""Espérame en el Cielo"" playing on radio]<br/>
<br/>
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?<br/>
<br/>
What do we do if we find<br/>
Pallomari's family in the apartment?<br/>
<br/>
Hope that we don't.<br/>
<br/>
We'll need to be quick.<br/>
I have someplace to be.<br/>
<br/>
The love of my life is in town<br/>
and we have a date.<br/>
<br/>
That's great.<br/>
<br/>
When was the last time you saw her?<br/>
<br/>
Eight years.<br/>
<br/>
Eight long years.<br/>
<br/>
Why so long since last time you saw her?<br/>
<br/>
You know, she was abroad.<br/>
<br/>
- In Japan.<br/>
- Japan?<br/>
<br/>
Working?<br/>
<br/>
She f*cked a police captain.<br/>
<br/>
Then tried to turn me in.<br/>
<br/>
All these years, I've been hanging around<br/>
her parents' house<br/>
<br/>
waiting for her to come back.<br/>
<br/>
People say things happen for a reason.<br/>
All I know is... she came back.<br/>
<br/>
She came back.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful day. Right?<br/>
<br/>
How many tents, give or take?<br/>
<br/>
I think around 20.<br/>
<br/>
The FARC arrange themselves<br/>
in staggered positions, two circles.<br/>
<br/>
Then they always go for lookouts<br/>
in high places along the trails.<br/>
<br/>
Sun sets in three hours.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as they hear the chopper,<br/>
they're going to hide.<br/>
<br/>
Generators, flashlights, fires...<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.<br/>
<br/>
Once the lights go, they'll use<br/>
guidelines strung into the jungle.<br/>
<br/>
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.<br/>
<br/>
Once we find one of those ropes...<br/>
<br/>
[imitates g*n]<br/>
<br/>
It's a f*cking slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
Berna.<br/>
<br/>
[soldiers counting down in unison]<br/>
<br/>
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me, Peña.<br/>
<br/>
You want the girl...<br/>
<br/>
there will be a body count.<br/>
<br/>
This is a w*r zone.<br/>
<br/>
But if you want,<br/>
we can still call this thing off.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get her back.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Just to be clear...<br/>
<br/>
something goes wrong...<br/>
<br/>
you still keep your promise.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,<br/>
try to keep him calm.<br/>
<br/>
- Then I come in.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
[exhales]<br/>
<br/>
[television playing in distance]<br/>
<br/>
[knocking]<br/>
<br/>
Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
Pallomari!<br/>
<br/>
[exhales]<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
He's not here, of course.<br/>
<br/>
[sighing]<br/>
<br/>
No luggage.<br/>
<br/>
Must've freaked out<br/>
when Miguel almost got caught.<br/>
<br/>
You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Guess that's why he's the accountant.<br/>
<br/>
And not a thug.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to find him.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel gave this priority.<br/>
Do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
I'll take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know when you have him.<br/>
<br/>
I need tonight<br/>
for the business I told you about.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Good luck then.<br/>

<br/>
Listen...<br/>
<br/>
any chatter from Pallomari?<br/>
<br/>
None I've heard. But we got him.<br/>
<br/>
- Who?<br/>
- Enrique.<br/>
<br/>
He called his brother, the idiot.<br/>
<br/>
David's on his way to get him.<br/>
<br/>
That's great news.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel must be pleased.<br/>
<br/>
[phone clicks]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
[beeps]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes?<br/>
<br/>
He showed up at the house?<br/>
<br/>
Meet us at 11th &amp; 614th.<br/>
<br/>
[phone line cuts]<br/>
<br/>
[Berna] You ever hear anything from Judy?<br/>
<br/>
[Peña] Not since you sold her out.<br/>
<br/>
Who would've thought it, Javier?<br/>
Both of us, bosses.<br/>
<br/>
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?<br/>
<br/>
It's good.<br/>
<br/>
You should see my house.<br/>
<br/>
I can take a shit in a different bathroom<br/>
every day of the week. My wife loves it.<br/>
<br/>
Your wife?<br/>
<br/>
I'm a family man.<br/>
<br/>
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.<br/>
<br/>
[Berna chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Guess catching guys like me...<br/>
<br/>
makes it all worth it. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget the suitcase.<br/>

Jorge, you're going to have<br/>
to explain some things.<br/>

<br/>
Alpha in position.<br/>
<br/>
[David] Tell him what you told us.<br/>

Huh?<br/>
<br/>
[Enrique] Salcedo knew about the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to talk to me<br/>
like a man, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
[winces]<br/>
<br/>
[yells] Salcedo works with the DEA!<br/>
<br/>
He knew the DEA was in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
He knew where they were at<br/>
and he told me to watch them.<br/>
<br/>
And he told me not to tell you.<br/>

We're going to push them out.<br/>
<br/>
We're circling back.<br/>
Arriving in 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
[Miguel] Is that true, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
Tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Are you working with the DEA?<br/>
<br/>
Sir... it's true<br/>
I've been successful tracking the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
But saying that I knew<br/>
where their safe house is, that's absurd.<br/>
<br/>
That's absurd.<br/>

<br/>
[indistinct yelling]<br/>
<br/>
Let's move.<br/>
<br/>
They're about to k*ll me because of you,<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
That f*cking son of a bitch is lying!<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for an infiltrator,<br/>
it's him, not me.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do<br/>
to my family if you say that shit?<br/>
<br/>
You son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
Let go of me!<br/>
I'll k*ll you, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
- Let it go, f*ck!<br/>
- Sir, that bastard is lying!<br/>
<br/>
What do you want me to say<br/>
if that's the truth, f*ck?!<br/>
<br/>
Cut the bullshit!<br/>
<br/>
[shouting]<br/>
<br/>
[Fidel] All right, men,<br/>
let's get these fireworks started.<br/>

This is easy. Get ready.<br/>

David, please. What is this?<br/>
<br/>
- Sir, I have no idea...<br/>
- [David] Dad...<br/>
<br/>

What the f*ck is that?<br/>
<br/>
[pager continues vibrating]<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck is that?<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Is that you, f*ck? Huh?<br/>
<br/>

[Carlos] Let's give those f*cking<br/>

[Fidel]<br/>
They're in the river! Give them lead!<br/>
<br/>
- Sir... it's a SkyPager.<br/>

<br/>
It's American high-end tech.<br/>
<br/>
- Don Miguel, please.<br/>
- Shut up.<br/>
<br/>
- What the f*ck does it say?<br/>
- Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
These are messages in English.<br/>
He's your rat!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck, you're going to have<br/>
my family k*ll dragging me into this!<br/>
<br/>
It's not yours?<br/>
<br/>
It's not yours, Enrique?<br/>
<br/>
- Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.<br/>
- Shh!<br/>
<br/>
I swear on my mom<br/>
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Can they track us with this shit?<br/>
<br/>
I think so, sir.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
- Don't move.<br/>
<br/>
- Please! Don Miguel, no!<br/>
- Don't move.<br/>
<br/>
No! Let me go!<br/>
<br/>
Tell the truth, f*ck!<br/>

Salcedo, you f*ck!<br/>

Ah! Don Miguel!<br/>

Put the g*n down!<br/>
<br/>
Don't move.<br/>

Your husband knows.<br/>
<br/>
He'll be waiting for you.<br/>
<br/>
It's all behind you now, Christina.<br/>
<br/>
And you think I should thank you for that?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't.<br/>
<br/>
No, you think you're a hero<br/>
because you, what,<br/>
<br/>
executed a bunch of farmers to get me out<br/>
<br/>
so that my husband would testify for you?<br/>
<br/>
I did what I had to do<br/>
and I'm sorry for what happened to you.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
No, you're not.<br/>

And you know it.<br/>
<br/>
You're a piece of shit.<br/>

Yeah, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Your code name for me? Natalia?<br/>

- What about it?<br/>
- They know. You have a leak.<br/>
<br/>
The cartel knows about it.<br/>

It won't be long before<br/>
they know about me.<br/>

This needs to happen now or I'm d*ad.<br/>

[in English] Yeah?<br/>

Yeah, we're about to get on the plane.<br/>
We'll be in Miami...<br/>

When?<br/>
<br/>
Let me call you back.<br/>
<br/>
[beeps]<br/>
<br/>
[""Amor Profundo"" playing]<br/>
<br/>
[music fades]</div>]","[grunts]

[in English] Come. It's gonna be fine.

Nothing is going to happen to you.

[in Spanish] Please...

[whimpering]

Please...

[whimpers]

No.

[indistinct chattering]

[gasps]

[indistinct chatter continues]

[chickens clucking]

[man] Take that with you.

[theme music playing]

[elevator clattering]

- [in Spanish] Careful.
- Yes, sir.

[Pedro] Were you sh*t?

No.

Get him out.

- You're scaring him.
- Out!

What happened last night...

someone pays.

We took care of Calderón,

but those f*cking gringos
still knock on my door!

Where the f*ck were the guards?

Where the f*ck were our men?

How the f*ck did they know
where you were, Dad? How the f*ck...?

We have a rat.

An informant.

They found my ledger.

[Darío] Hey, what about Enrique?

He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

[dog barking at a distance]

[scooter whizzes by]

[brakes screech]

[pager vibrating]

[beeps]

[sighs]

- [pager thumps]
- [compartment door closes]

[giggling]

[Paola] Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

- Girls, please.
- [giggles]

No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

- Honey, let's go inside. Inside.
- [phone ringing]

- Hello?
- [David] Salcedo.

No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the f*ck are you?

David.

I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

but I'm monitoring my radio.

- Have you talked to Enrique?
- Why?

We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

Do you have any problem with that?

I'll find him.

Good. Bring him in.

And Salcedo, you come, too.

[phone line cuts]

[sighs]

[in English] I stand by the operation,
Minister, as does General Serrano.

Who was in Bogotá at the time of the raid,

while you and your men were there
for five hours,

drilling holes, breaking furniture.

We were one minute away
from getting Miguel Rodríguez.

But you did not.

I need you to hand over all intel,
including informants,

over to a special prosecutor.

And I'm afraid the DEA can no longer
be part of this operation.

- You're taking us off?
- Yes, I am.

Minister, we recovered something
from the house.

It's a ledger.

Cartel accounts, transactions,
going back years.

- What is this? I don't see names.
- It's coded.

It's bribes, money laundering...
cocaine sales.

- Cali's whole operation.
- That's right.

- And do you have someone who can read it?
- There are two possibilities.

There's the cartel accountant,
Guillermo Pallomari.

Yeah, but he's underground. Maybe worse.

And there's the money launderer
we extradited from Curaçao,

Franklin Jurado.

Jurado's the most important witness
to this case and he's in U.S. custody.

We're not handing him over
to a special prosecutor.

So you're welcome
to keep the ledger, Minister...

but we have the only guy who can read it.

Then, Agent Peña,
I suppose you have to see this out.

- [book clatters on table]
- [Crosby clears throat]

- Ambassador.
- Minister.

[door opens]

[sighs]

[door creaks, closes]

[sighs]

You make my job a lot f*cking harder,
you know that?

Now you told me the only way Jurado talks
is if you find his wife.

Do you have any idea where she is?

I know someone who might.

[""La Vuelta"" playing]

[Peña] After the fall of Escobar,

Medellín went from being
the most dangerous city in Colombia...

to one of its safest.

This wasn't a result
of the end of cocaine tr*ffick.

That was alive and well.

It was due
to the new godfather of Medellín.

His name is Diego Murillo,
but you know him as Don Berna.

[in Spanish] Did you find her?

Sure you don't want something?

- The picada here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

Pretty girl.

Long way from home.

[Peña in English]
Gotta be f*cking kidding me.

[in Spanish] I'm imagining the headline...

""American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle."" f*ck.

- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

I'm going to help you
rescue the Barbie doll.

To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

They can help us.

They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

What's it going to cost?

Cheap.

You just have to make me a promise, Peña.

When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list...

you pick up the phone and call me.

So I can be cautious and protect myself.

[tsks]

I see now.

[in English] A get-out-of-jail-free card.

[chuckles]

[in English] Exactly.

[in Spanish] To us, Peña.

Enrique!

Boss.

Open the door. Quick.

- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

- What happened?
- David has been calling.

What for? He never called before.

- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big f*ck up.

You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

I should just run, bro.

Like Córdova?

What? It doesn't matter!

Stay, run. It's the same f*cking thing!

No matter what I do,
I'm a f*cking d*ad man.

Nobody is going to die, you hear me?

Nobody is going to die.

But right now,
let's just get you to tomorrow, Enrique.

[beeping]

[in English] Keep paging him
until he hits us back.

Nothing else we can do.

f*ck.

We should've arrested him.

You know, brought him in for as*ault
or something to save him.

f*ck. I hope we didn't
hang him out to dry.

I thought you didn't like him.

[scoffs]

Yeah, doesn't mean I want him d*ad.

[in Spanish] Why the f*ck do I have
to hide here? I didn't do anything.

I know you didn't do anything.

This is David being an idiot.

But... trust me.
Have some patience. I'll handle it.

Jorge...

last week,
when you told me to not say anything...

- about the DEA and their safe house...
- Hey.

That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up?

Stay focused.

Sit down.

Sit down.

It's very important you do what I say.

Don't leave this room.

And don't call anyone.

Not your mother, your brother
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

Hey, look at me.

We'll get you through this.

I promise.

Thank you, Jorge.

Seriously.

- Jorge.
- Fercho, how's it going?

Don Miguel.

Where the f*ck is Enrique, Jorge?

I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

but trust me, I'll find him.

Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

He's a man we can trust.

The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.

Because I didn't hire him, you did.

No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

and we don't know them, David.

I find that funny, you know?

Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

More specifically,
about the f*cking DEA, Jorge.

Huh?

When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

Don Miguel, I've been investigating
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

Dad...

Dad, please.

It could be.

It could be.

But you know what, Jorge?

That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

Yes, sir.

Someone sang and I want to know
who the f*ck it was.

Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

We f*cking fix this once and for all.

[car brakes screech]

- Hi, fellas.
- Sir.

Welcome.

Hello.

[Peña in English]
w*r makes for strange alliances,

putting you into business
with people that,

under other circumstances,
you wouldn't even shake hands with.

[in Spanish] Great machine.

You people know how to build
a f*cking as*ault chopper.

[Peña in English]
The same is true of your enemies.

They will unite when they need to.

FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia,

were a guerrilla army
about 17,000 strong...

engaged in the longest civil w*r
in modern history.

And in the early days of that w*r,
how did they finance their struggle?

Kidnapping.

Wealthy Colombians would pay a ransom

to have their loved ones
returned unharmed.

So when the Cali cartel
wanted to keep someone on ice,

safely hidden somewhere
in the middle of the jungle,

they hired the pros.

For a hefty fee, of course.

[Peña in Spanish] Nice look, Berna.

You're coming on the raid?

[chuckles] Thanks, but no.

I'm coming to make sure
all goes well with our friends.

Look at me.

Do you think an important man like me...

is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

[chuckles]

You don't know how to take a joke.

[whirring]

[car humming]

I'll go in.

Sure.

But they go with you.

What about you, brother?
Are you trying to f*ck us all or what?

Calm down, Gilberto.

Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.

You don't want to surrender,
and you let them get the g*dd*mn ledger!

Since you were a kid, I had to tell you
what to do and what not to...

You know what, Gilberto?

Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.
Why don't you just shut up?

[beeps]

He's f*cking lost his mind.

All these acts of v*olence
in the North Valley

are straining our friends' patience.

Any surrender deal's hanging by a thread.

Uncle Miguel has to see that.

I told him, no v*olence.

Is this all my fault?

Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

Franklin Jurado.

I need to reach out to Chepe. Or Pacho.

But how the f*ck...?

There's no one else I can trust with this.

Let's see...

Dad.

Nicolás...

I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

Hello.

Any news?

He has a girlfriend
on the other side of town.

Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

Ah... Thanks.

I think I'll wait here.

You know he's a mama's boy.
That f*ck will be back.

So now what?

[sighs]

Now you go to Toro n*gro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

He'll give you
an assignment from my father.

Why didn't he call me?

I'm going to explain something to you.

Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

Yes, sir.

Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

[rock music playing]

[man] Coming up to coordinates Kirk 5-7,
maneuver incoming.

[Peña in English] Private militias
not only weren't illegal in Colombia,

they were encouraged.

A government program called CONVIVIR
was started in 1994.

And it authorized private security forces

to take up arms
against the communist guerrillas.

A free pass for crimes against humanity,
sponsored by Uncle Sam.

[in Spanish]
Gentlemen. So good to see you again.

Third generation night vision goggles.

The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

[Peña in English] The Castaños ran
the largest private militia in Colombia.

Their AUC,
or AutodefensasUnidas de Colombia,

numbered in the tens of thousands.

Their victims...
in the hundreds of thousands.

Theirs was a perpetual w*r.

And if you're hunting communist guerrillas
in the jungle, they were your only call.

[blasts]

This one has AFCS.

And the 701 engine. Hmm.

[chuckles]

- Not like last time.
- [Peña] Last time?

The CIA.

They had us out here hunting commies
on Christmas day.

- That's real dedication.
- It is God's work.

Merry Christmas.

[David] My dad trusts him, but...
did you see him?

[Darío] That son of a bitch
looks nervous, right?

[David] Never stopped
adjusting the mirror, staring.

I kind of love how much
this f*ck hates me.

[David and Darío chuckle]

[David] Our man in Bogotá
confirmed there must be an informant.

[Darío] Huh?

[David] Salcedo has to be the one
the gringos are calling ""Natalia.""

I'm going to love
k*ll that f*ck.

You know who else I am going to k*ll?
His arrogant wife.

I'm going to leave
those poor girls orphans.

[Darío] Poor things.

[David] You can adopt them.

[laughs] You son of a bitch...

[shudders]

[beeping]

[phone ringing]

Answer.

[Paola on voice mail]
This is Paola, leave a message.

Hello, love, it's me.

Paola, listen, I need you to call me back.

It's very important.

[car approaching]

[knocking]

Take me to where you stashed him,
Jorge Salcedo.

Stashed who?

Pallomari.

Are we taking him someplace?

Uh-uh.

I see.

What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

I have a business to run, Guillermo.

A meeting with who?

With Fredy. We're meeting a new client.

Fredy? Patricia,
the police almost caught Miguel yesterday.

For f*ck's sake.

What's the problem?

You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

Yes, but always within limits.

You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

They need you. You're the brains
behind the organization...

None of that matters, Patricia, none,
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

You're giving me a headache.

Listen to me.

My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

It's just a couple hours.

Call me if there's a problem.

[door opens]

[""Espérame en el Cielo"" playing on radio]

What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

Hope that we don't.

We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

That's great.

When was the last time you saw her?

Eight years.

Eight long years.

Why so long since last time you saw her?

You know, she was abroad.

- In Japan.
- Japan?

Working?

She f*cked a police captain.

Then tried to turn me in.

All these years, I've been hanging around
her parents' house

waiting for her to come back.

People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

She came back.

Beautiful day. Right?

How many tents, give or take?

I think around 20.

The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

Sun sets in three hours.

As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

Once the lights go, they'll use
guidelines strung into the jungle.

They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

Once we find one of those ropes...

[imitates g*n]

It's a f*cking slaughter.

Berna.

[soldiers counting down in unison]

Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

Listen to me, Peña.

You want the girl...

there will be a body count.

This is a w*r zone.

But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

I need to get her back.

[chuckles]

Just to be clear...

something goes wrong...

you still keep your promise.

Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

- Then I come in.
- Okay.

[exhales]

[television playing in distance]

[knocking]

Pallomari.

Pallomari!

[exhales]

[chuckles]

He's not here, of course.

[sighing]

No luggage.

Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.

[chuckles]

Guess that's why he's the accountant.

And not a thug.

Hey, Salcedo.

You'll need to find him.

Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

I'll take care of it.

Let me know when you have him.

I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

Oh.

Sure.

[sighs]

Good luck then.

[beeping]

[phone ringing]

- [Jorge] Hey, it's me.
- Salcedo! Busy today.

Listen...

any chatter from Pallomari?

None I've heard. But we got him.

- Who?
- Enrique.

He called his brother, the idiot.

David's on his way to get him.

That's great news.

Miguel must be pleased.

[phone clicks]

[phone ringing]

[beeps]

- David?
- We have him.

Yes?

He showed up at the house?

Meet us at 11th &amp; 614th.

[phone line cuts]

[Berna] You ever hear anything from Judy?

[Peña] Not since you sold her out.

Who would've thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

It's good.

You should see my house.

I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week. My wife loves it.

Your wife?

I'm a family man.

Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

[Berna chuckles]

Guess catching guys like me...

makes it all worth it. Right?

Don't forget the suitcase.

[commanding officer]
Keep going!

Come on. Let's go!
Assume position!

[man] Be advised, team: five minutes to LZ.

Get ready.

[groans]

[sniffs]

[in Spanish] Ah...
Our guest of honor's arrived.

[coughs, blood splatters]

What's going on here?

Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

[crickets chirping]

[indistinct chatter]

Alpha in position.

[David] Tell him what you told us.

Huh?

[Enrique] Salcedo knew about the DEA.

You're going to talk to me
like a man, f*ck.

[winces]

[yells] Salcedo works with the DEA!

He knew the DEA was in Cali.

He knew where they were at
and he told me to watch them.

And he told me not to tell you.
[coughing]

[Carlos over radio] Charlie in position.

Bravo in position.

Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

[pilot] Copy that.
We're going to push them out.

We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.

[Miguel] Is that true, Jorge?

Tell me.

Tell me.

Are you working with the DEA?

Sir... it's true
I've been successful tracking the DEA.

But saying that I knew
where their safe house is, that's absurd.

That's absurd.

[pilot]
Rotor ETA five seconds. We have visual.

- [men shouting]
- [rustling]

[pilot] FARC is on the move.
They're going dark.

[Fidel] Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.

[indistinct yelling]

Let's move.

They're about to k*ll me because of you,
f*ck!

That f*cking son of a bitch is lying!

If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

You son of a bitch!

Let go of me!
I'll k*ll you, f*ck!

- Let it go, f*ck!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, f*ck?!

Cut the bullshit!

[shouting]

[Fidel] All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.

[Carlos] And don't be pussies.
This is easy. Get ready.

- [g*n]
- This shit is on! [laughs]

[g*n continues]

I'm tired of this, Dad.

- [Jorge] Sir, no.
- [cocks g*n]

David, please. What is this?

- Sir, I have no idea...
- [David] Dad...

[pager vibrating]

What the f*ck is that?

[pager continues vibrating]

What the f*ck is that?

Huh?

Is that you, f*ck? Huh?

- No.
- What the f*ck is that?

[panting]

- What the f*ck is this?
- I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

[Carlos] Let's give those f*cking
guerrillas a rain of b*ll*ts!

[Fidel]
They're in the river! Give them lead!

- Sir... it's a SkyPager.
- [Enrique coughs]

It's American high-end tech.

- Don Miguel, please.
- Shut up.

- What the f*ck does it say?
- Let's see.

These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

f*ck, you're going to have
my family k*ll dragging me into this!

It's not yours?

It's not yours, Enrique?

- Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.
- Shh!

I swear on my mom
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel.

Can they track us with this shit?

I think so, sir.

f*ck!

- No.
- Don't move.

- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

No! Let me go!

Tell the truth, f*ck!

Salcedo, you f*ck!

Ah! Don Miguel!

[Enrique gasping]

Look, Jorge.

Your friend.

- [Peña] Christina.
- [in English] Don't. Don't.

[in Spanish]
Stay where you are.

Put the g*n down!

Don't move.

- [Peña in English] Stay still.
- Please.

- [in Spanish] One more step and...
- [Christina screams]

[Christina shuddering]

The rat is d*ad.

[Fidel] What's wrong?

Start.

[g*n]

[phone rings]

- Feistl.
- [Peña] I have her.

Get Franklin ready.

- [g*n]
- [screams, whimpers]

[g*n]

[whirring]

[in Spanish] Yes, I know my signature.

- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

Where's Mom?

Jorge?

She doesn't want to see you.

Paola!

Paola!

Paola!

Have some respect. This is my mom's house.

What's going on?

What is it?

What's going on?

Breathe.

[sobbing]

What happened?

What's going on? Come here.

[indistinct chatter over PA]

[in English] In less than an hour,
we're on that plane.

Your husband knows.

He'll be waiting for you.

It's all behind you now, Christina.

And you think I should thank you for that?

No.

No, I don't.

No, you think you're a hero
because you, what,

executed a bunch of farmers to get me out

so that my husband would testify for you?

I did what I had to do
and I'm sorry for what happened to you.

No.

No, you're not.

And you know it.

You're a piece of shit.

[phone ringing]

- Salcedo?
- [Jorge] I know where Miguel is.

This needs to happen right now.

Yeah, of course.

Your code name for me? Natalia?

- What about it?
- They know. You have a leak.

The cartel knows about it.

It won't be long before
they know about me.

This needs to happen now or I'm d*ad.

Call for you. Number four.

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

[Lucho] Brother.

[in Spanish] That phone doesn't work.

Try number five.

[indistinct chatter]

You're Colombian.

Right?

I'm from Cali.

[in English] Hello?

Hello?

[cell phone ringing]

[in Spanish] Yeah?

Hey... it's been taken care of.

[cell phone ringing]

[beeps]

[in English] Yeah?

Yeah, we're about to get on the plane.
We'll be in Miami...

When?

Let me call you back.

Until that happens,<br/>

Make sure Orlando Henao gets the message.<br/>

And now...<br/>

[police sirens]<br/>
<br/>
[g*n]<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English]<br/>
w*r had returned to Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Cocaine cartels are about succession.<br/>
<br/>
The number two guys realize that<br/>
the number one guys are on their way out.<br/>
<br/>
So they decide to speed things up.<br/>
<br/>
With Gilberto Rodríguez in jail,<br/>
there was blood in the water.<br/>
<br/>
And blood begets more blood.<br/>
<br/>
I told you that Cali ran their empire<br/>
like a business.<br/>
<br/>
Well, when your business gets too big,<br/>
you start selling franchises.<br/>
<br/>
Cali basically allowed tr*ffick<br/>
who would normally be their rivals<br/>
<br/>
to work under the umbrella<br/>
of their political protection...<br/>
<br/>
to use their cocaine distribution network<br/>
<br/>
and to take advantage of their muscle<br/>
when shit got heavy.<br/>
<br/>
In return, they demanded loyalty<br/>
and a hefty cut of the profits.<br/>
<br/>
And for a long time, that was cool.<br/>
<br/>
But as brilliant<br/>
as Cali's surrender plan was,<br/>
<br/>
it didn't take into account that<br/>
nobody wants to retire in second place.<br/>
<br/>
North Valley cartel<br/>
was ready for first place.<br/>
<br/>
tr*ffick like Iván Urdinola...<br/>
<br/>
Henry Loaiza,<br/>
<br/>
Gerda Salazar,<br/>
<br/>
and the North Valley boss, Orlando Henao.<br/>
<br/>
They didn't need to retire.<br/>
<br/>
They controlled not only<br/>
the rural North Valley,<br/>
<br/>
but the port of Buenaventura,<br/>
<br/>
from which most of the world's<br/>
cocaine shipped.<br/>
<br/>
It was the jewel in their crown.<br/>
<br/>
And they did business...<br/>
differently than Cali.<br/>
<br/>
[screaming]<br/>
<br/>
Let's just say they didn't give a shit<br/>
about public relations.<br/>
<br/>
""f*ck the Gentlemen of Cali,""<br/>
they figured.<br/>
<br/>
With the port and Cali's<br/>
current legal troubles,<br/>
<br/>
they had a sh*t at taking over.<br/>
<br/>
It is often said in organized crime...<br/>
<br/>
[Miguel in Spanish]<br/>
...w*r is bad for business.<br/>
<br/>
Unless it's won.<br/>
<br/>
Buenaventura is in Henao's territory.<br/>
<br/>
We have to get the port back<br/>
so we can maintain our delivery schedules.<br/>
<br/>
You think that...<br/>
<br/>
Can it be done?<br/>
<br/>
Negotiating with the government,<br/>
and the f*cking surrender...<br/>
<br/>
it all means one thing.<br/>
<br/>
Our allies and enemies think we're weak.<br/>
<br/>
My brother Gilberto<br/>
is responsible for that.<br/>
<br/>
How's Alvaro?<br/>
<br/>
What do you want me to say, Miguel?<br/>
<br/>
The doctors still don't know<br/>
if his cock will ever work again.<br/>
<br/>
He's 22 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I swear to you, Pacho,<br/>
the Salazars will pay for that shit.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] You know where Miguel is.<br/>
Why haven't you arrested him?<br/>
<br/>
It's not that simple, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of operation<br/>
needs to be vetted, approved.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute.<br/>
How many people know about this?<br/>
<br/>
Very few. And nobody knows your name.<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna arrest<br/>
Miguel Rodríguez, all right?<br/>
<br/>
And you can put all this behind you.<br/>
<br/>
- Can I ask what your plan is?<br/>
- Small team, just before dawn.<br/>
<br/>
- When?<br/>
- Zero-four-hundred. Tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Transpo's three trucks<br/>
coming from different directions...<br/>
<br/>
No, that's not gonna work. Miguel has<br/>
rotating security around the building.<br/>
<br/>
They see anything unusual,<br/>
a call goes out to Fercho Castillo.<br/>
<br/>
That's Miguel's assistant.<br/>
<br/>
They'll be out<br/>
before you get through the lobby.<br/>
<br/>
So then help us find<br/>
a blind spot in the perimeter.<br/>
<br/>
There's no blind spots.<br/>
These people are professional.<br/>
<br/>
- What about if we hit at shift change?<br/>
- We overlap shifts because of that reason.<br/>
<br/>
- [sighs]<br/>
- Guys!<br/>
<br/>
That's it? That's the plan?<br/>
<br/>
- [Van Ness clears throat]<br/>
- [Jorge] Christ.<br/>
<br/>
Have your entire team take Carrera Diez.<br/>
Make a turn at Avenida Siete.<br/>
<br/>
I'll post a man there<br/>
that's gonna let you guys through.<br/>
<br/>
You're putting a lot of faith in this guy.<br/>
You sure we can count on him?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be posted there,<br/>
but if you don't get Miguel,<br/>
<br/>
they're gonna k*ll me.<br/>
Do you understand that?<br/>
<br/>
- They're gonna k*ll my family, my kids.<br/>
- We're not gonna let that happen.<br/>
<br/>
Next time we see you, we're putting you<br/>
and your family on a plane to America.<br/>
<br/>
[Feistl] You're getting out.<br/>
Just like we promised.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña] With Miguel Rodríguez in charge,<br/>
<br/>
we're dealing<br/>
with a different kind of cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Then maybe you<br/>
shouldn't have arrested his brother.<br/>
<br/>
This operation could significantly impact<br/>
the cartel's day-to-day,<br/>
<br/>
stop the bloodshed.<br/>
<br/>
Based on information<br/>
you're unwilling to share.<br/>
<br/>
- Well, due to the sensitivity...<br/>
- Yes, you've said.<br/>
<br/>
But gentlemen, to ask me to sign off<br/>
on this operation blindly?<br/>
<br/>
You haven't given me anything<br/>
other than a code name.<br/>
<br/>
How much can you trust this informant...<br/>
""Natalia""?<br/>
<br/>
Or is that too much to ask?<br/>
<br/>
I understand your frustration.<br/>
<br/>
But I've been assured<br/>
that this intelligence is viable.<br/>
<br/>
If you won't tell me what you have,<br/>
then please, get to what you need.<br/>
<br/>
- A small team. No more than ten men.<br/>
- Contact General Vargas.<br/>
<br/>
- I'll authorize him to provide you one.<br/>
- Actually, sir,<br/>
<br/>
we were hoping you would provide<br/>
somebody independent of General Vargas.<br/>
<br/>
[clears throat] If you would<br/>
just indulge us this one request.<br/>
<br/>
Shall I assume you have someone in mind?<br/>
<br/>
General Serrano, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Agente Peña...<br/>
<br/>
another setback and I won't be able<br/>
to help you, nor will I want to.<br/>
<br/>
The case for the surrender deal<br/>
will only be strengthened.<br/>
<br/>
And you and your team will be gone.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your honesty, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Minister.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña]<br/>
Through intimidation and corruption...<br/>
<br/>
the Cali Cartel had effectively taken much<br/>
of the Colombian National Police force...<br/>
<br/>
MONASTERY OF EL CARMEN<br/>
<br/>
...and bent them to its will.<br/>
<br/>
But there was one force it couldn't bend:<br/>
<br/>
a man named General José Serrano...<br/>
<br/>
whose faith and integrity<br/>
were exactly what we needed.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Agent Peña, nice to meet you.<br/>
Your reputation precedes you.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English]<br/>
Serrano took two things seriously:<br/>
<br/>
his service to God...<br/>
<br/>
and his belief in the rule of law.<br/>
<br/>
He expected the same from his men.<br/>
<br/>
For him, it began at an early age.<br/>
<br/>
He was a campesino,<br/>
the son of a dirt farmer...<br/>
<br/>
He had never owned a pair of shoes.<br/>
<br/>
One day, a group of mounted policemen<br/>
rode into his village.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded him of the holy knights<br/>
that he had read about,<br/>
<br/>
religious warriors on a mission from God.<br/>
<br/>
He knew then...<br/>
<br/>
that he would be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
He joined the force expecting<br/>
to find other like-minded men.<br/>
<br/>
But instead, he found corruption.<br/>
<br/>
From where he could, he rooted it out.<br/>
<br/>
When he became chief<br/>
of his first small town,<br/>
<br/>
he fired over two-thirds of the department<br/>
for being on the take...<br/>
<br/>
ANTI-NARCOTIC POLICE<br/>
<br/>
...declaring w*r on corrupt cops<br/>
and tr*ffick alike.<br/>
<br/>
[Serrano in Spanish] I will put<br/>
in maximum effort, with all my soul,<br/>
<br/>
into fighting corruption.<br/>
<br/>
Because when there is corruption...<br/>
<br/>
there is no procedure,<br/>
there is no peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English] Twenty years, numerous<br/>
failed assassination attempts later...<br/>
<br/>
he was still waging his w*r.<br/>
<br/>
By the book, of course.<br/>
<br/>
[Serrano in Spanish]<br/>
This informant of yours,<br/>
<br/>
is he close to Miguel Rodríguez?<br/>
<br/>
He's provided us with Miguel's location.<br/>
<br/>
That's why it's urgent we move now.<br/>
<br/>
May take a miracle<br/>
to get this close again.<br/>
<br/>
Only God creates miracles.<br/>
<br/>
It's for us to use the tools he's bestowed<br/>
to resolve these matters.<br/>
<br/>
Any chance God's bestowed the right men<br/>
to pull off this operation?<br/>
<br/>
God has many soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Mine are honest men<br/>
who answer to higher powers than you or I.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not concerned about them.<br/>
But I'm worried about other issues.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest<br/>
has led to new stipulations.<br/>
<br/>
From now on, any warrant I sign<br/>
<br/>
has to be filed<br/>
with the local fiscale office in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Which the cartel will know about.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly.<br/>
<br/>
Truth is, your tactics<br/>
won't be allowed a second run.<br/>
<br/>
Just have to find new ones, General.<br/>
<br/>
Your men, General, where are they now?<br/>
<br/>
Awaiting their orders.<br/>
<br/>
The target is Miguel Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
Our operation will succeed<br/>
<br/>
because you fulfill your duty to your God<br/>
<br/>
and to your country. Understood?<br/>
<br/>
[all] Yes, sir!<br/>
<br/>
The operation from a strategic<br/>
point of view is a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
There's a security perimeter.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,<br/>
the target knows we're inside.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Feistl and I will be<br/>
right behind you, arriving by helicopter.<br/>
<br/>
We'll land on the roof<br/>
and come in from above.<br/>
<br/>
- We're going to box them in.<br/>
- [Peña] Yes.<br/>
<br/>
We have an inside man.<br/>
<br/>
He'll be posted right here,<br/>
giving us our best way in.<br/>
<br/>
[Paola] Which one do you want?<br/>
<br/>
- [Alma and Vera] This one!<br/>
- Okay. Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Girls, please get ready.<br/>
<br/>
Paola... you can't do this.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm taking the girls to my parents'.<br/>
- Paola, you can't do this.<br/>
<br/>
Especially with what's going on<br/>
with the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
What? What are you saying?<br/>
<br/>
Are you telling me I can't protect<br/>
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?<br/>
<br/>
No. What I'm saying is that we need<br/>
to act normal, like everything is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Everything isn't fine, Jorge.<br/>
Everything isn't fine.<br/>
<br/>
They could be watching you, me, the girls.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel's become paranoid.<br/>
Do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
I'll call you in a few days.<br/>
The girls will want to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
Paola. Please.<br/>
<br/>
The Americans are going to try<br/>
to arrest Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to make sure they succeed.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.<br/>
You, me, the girls.<br/>
<br/>
We're leaving Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?<br/>
<br/>
Who told you our girls want to leave<br/>
the only home they've ever known?<br/>
<br/>
So we need to disappear.<br/>
Is that your plan?<br/>
<br/>
Explain to me again, I don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
What happens if the Americans fail?<br/>
<br/>
[scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Paola, please. Please... wait.<br/>
<br/>
Don't leave.<br/>
<br/>
We weren't poor, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
We always had choices.<br/>
<br/>
This was your choice.<br/>
<br/>
[Serrano] What about the warrant?<br/>
<br/>
You still haven't filed the paperwork,<br/>
<br/>
and I can't authorize this raid<br/>
without it.<br/>
<br/>
We're bringing the fiscale with us.<br/>
<br/>
Until we're on-site,<br/>
no one else knows the real target.<br/>
<br/>
Arrest him quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Because if word of this gets out,<br/>
<br/>
they'll try to stop us<br/>
with everything they've got.<br/>
<br/>
General...<br/>
<br/>
General...<br/>
<br/>
one more thing.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to ask you to remain in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my men.<br/>
That's my signature on the warrant.<br/>
<br/>
Which puts your name on the line, sir.<br/>
<br/>
If anything goes wrong,<br/>
and we look like...<br/>
<br/>
Like what? Like idiots?<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't be the first time,<br/>
as I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
You don't trust me.<br/>
<br/>
But you can't do this without me.<br/>
<br/>
That's true,<br/>
but I know the system we're up against.<br/>
<br/>
With your name on the warrant...<br/>
<br/>
there's no doubt<br/>
the cartel's watching you.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you make the arrest,<br/>
<br/>
I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodríguez<br/>
into custody when the press arrive.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stay here praying for your success,<br/>
because there's no doubt...<br/>
<br/>
it's your reputation now on the line.<br/>
<br/>
[engine starts]<br/>
<br/>
Hi, boss. What's going on?<br/>
Getting a little late for you, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Just checking in.<br/>
<br/>
You run those taps over in El Lido<br/>
<br/>
- like I asked?<br/>
- [in English] Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- [in Spanish] Perfect.<br/>
- All right. Well done.<br/>
<br/>
Enrique, why don't you take off<br/>
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?<br/>
<br/>
Is this some kind of test?<br/>
<br/>
Someone offers me a day off, I say yes.<br/>
<br/>
My wife's been hounding me.<br/>
<br/>
I could use a night away<br/>
from all of her questions, Enrique.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad I'm not married yet.<br/>
<br/>
Don't make that mistake.<br/>
<br/>
[laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, boss.<br/>
<br/>
[pager beeping]<br/>
<br/>
It's Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, boss.<br/>
I'll hang out until you get back.<br/>

Good.<br/>

Come on in.<br/>
<br/>
[Miguel] We can discuss that later.<br/>
<br/>
He's here now.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you've said.<br/>
<br/>
Bye.<br/>
<br/>
My son.<br/>
<br/>
You know how he is. A little...<br/>
<br/>
complicated.<br/>
<br/>
He is your son.<br/>
<br/>
[chatter over radio]<br/>
<br/>
[in English]<br/>
This the guy with the warrant?<br/>
<br/>
[Feistl] Yeah, I think so.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Looks friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I don't give a shit,<br/>
as long as he does what he's told.<br/>
<br/>
[Miguel in Spanish] Good things<br/>
are coming, Jorge. You'll be part of it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad, sir. Is there anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Take a seat.<br/>
<br/>
You know that my brother...<br/>
<br/>
he doesn't like this w*r thing.<br/>
<br/>
He thinks it's a mistake,<br/>
being at w*r with the North Valley.<br/>
<br/>
He said this brings too much tension,<br/>
<br/>
with the v*olence and everything.<br/>
<br/>
He's getting counsel from men<br/>
I don't trust at all.<br/>
<br/>
Those phones that you...<br/>
<br/>
how do you call it? Wiretaps?<br/>
<br/>
Wiretap.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think...<br/>
<br/>
you could put one<br/>
on my brother's phone in prison?<br/>
<br/>
You want me<br/>
to tap Gilberto's phone in prison?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
For his own good.<br/>
<br/>
Only if it became necessary.<br/>
<br/>
So... for him.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, sir. Anything you need.<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
This stays here.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I should get back downstairs.<br/>
I'm posted outside tonight.<br/>
<br/>
You? Nonsense. You're too old for that!<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.<br/>
<br/>
No. No way.<br/>
Have one of the young guys do it.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I'm eating late.<br/>
Fercho was about to make something.<br/>
<br/>
You'll join us.<br/>
<br/>
You'll join us, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Fercho! We will be two. Come.<br/>
<br/>
[tires screeching]<br/>
<br/>
[whirring]<br/>
<br/>
[Fercho] Do you like filets, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, very much.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you...<br/>
<br/>
the building guys,<br/>
they've been idling in front of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Blocking our exit.<br/>
<br/>
You see that?<br/>
Feels good when one's been taken care of.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Keep your walkie charged.<br/>
<br/>
And the exits clear.<br/>
<br/>
Like you said.<br/>
<br/>
You want one?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Look,<br/>
I have a bottle of white wine that is...<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, boss, if it's not<br/>
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. It's a shame, but... okay.<br/>
<br/>
But I have a really nice bottle<br/>
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.<br/>
<br/>
[chatter over radio]<br/>
<br/>
[Fercho]<br/>
You're in for a treat tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel has me cooking<br/>
with these Japanese bread crumbs.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds crazy,<br/>
but it's actually more tasty.<br/>
<br/>
That's very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Fercho, looks like the oil's ready.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Boss! Boss! Boss!<br/>
<br/>
We have cars heading towards the building.<br/>
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.<br/>
This is a residence...<br/>
<br/>
[in English] We have a warrant. Hey.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] A residence?<br/>
<br/>
[in English] What?<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Hear that?<br/>
<br/>
Enrique! What the f*ck is going on?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't inform us<br/>
there's a helicopter?<br/>
<br/>
- How the f*ck did they find us?!<br/>
- Sir, calm down.<br/>
<br/>
We need to get you out of here now.<br/>
There's no time to discuss this.<br/>
<br/>
- Miguel, what's happening?<br/>
- You need to hide.<br/>
<br/>
Is there somewhere we can take you?<br/>
A caleta in the apartment?<br/>
<br/>
Stop. Get to the lobby.<br/>
Get to the lobby and stop them.<br/>
<br/>
It's better if he goes.<br/>
Every second counts.<br/>
<br/>
Get to the lobby! Stop them.<br/>
<br/>
María.<br/>
<br/>
[whispers in English] No, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
- Colombian law.<br/>
- No, but if he's got a caleta in there...<br/>
<br/>
If you want anything we do in there<br/>
to count, follow the f*cking rules.<br/>
<br/>
Van Ness. Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
I need the fiscale upstairs.<br/>
Where the f*ck are you?<br/>
<br/>
This isn't a financial building.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel Rodríguez is upstairs.<br/>
We have the warrant.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Without an address filed in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
So fill it in.<br/>
<br/>
As I've told you, my office authorized<br/>
the search of a financial corporation.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] What the f*ck is this?<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Hands in the air!<br/>
<br/>
[elevator dings]<br/>
<br/>
Look, sir, as I told your agent,<br/>
I can't do...<br/>
<br/>
Write the address in right now.<br/>
That's why you're here.<br/>
<br/>
You decide how you want this to go.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
- [in Spanish] Are you Fernando Castillo?<br/>
- What's all this?<br/>
<br/>
We're here to arrest Miguel Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel isn't here.<br/>
<br/>
[man] There's nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Look above.<br/>
<br/>
Take that off!<br/>
<br/>
[man 2] Cabinets!<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing here.<br/>
<br/>
Try the ones below.<br/>
<br/>
[sirens blaring]<br/>
<br/>
Who's in charge here?<br/>
<br/>
I asked you a question.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorized<br/>
to let anyone inside.<br/>
<br/>
You see this f*cking badge?<br/>
<br/>
Your superiors failed to report<br/>
this operation with the local bureau.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to know<br/>
who'll be answering for that.<br/>
<br/>
These are direct orders<br/>
from my superiors, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Step out of my way.<br/>
<br/>
Peinados, stay here.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
[man] Move!<br/>
<br/>
Sergeant, you copy?<br/>
The local police are heading up.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the back, please.<br/>
You can sit on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
[María] How long is this going to take?<br/>
<br/>
[Van Ness] Chris.<br/>
<br/>
[María] What are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, kid. Where is he?<br/>
Was Miguel Rodríguez here?<br/>
<br/>
Don't speak to my son.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Can he please go to his room?<br/>
He's just a child.<br/>
<br/>
- Is the room clear?<br/>
- Clear.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, leave. Go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Flores.<br/>
<br/>
- Who's in charge here?<br/>
- DEA.<br/>
<br/>
I assume with Colombian support.<br/>
<br/>
[scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
I don't see a ranking officer.<br/>
<br/>
Guess that puts me in charge.<br/>
<br/>
There's an exit over there<br/>
that leads to the street.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have anyone posted there?<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd properly notified my unit,<br/>
we could have blocked that exit<br/>
<br/>
- and prevented this escape.<br/>
- There's no evidence he got out.<br/>
<br/>
That's why you're looking<br/>
through the kitchen cabinets?<br/>
<br/>
[Dario] David!<br/>
<br/>
[knocking on door]<br/>
<br/>
David!<br/>
<br/>
Wake up, man! We have to go.<br/>
<br/>
Let go of her already.<br/>
<br/>
[sniffs, groans]<br/>
<br/>
Come on, man!<br/>
<br/>
[in English] I think it's time<br/>
you call Natalia.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what she's heard.<br/>
<br/>
Um...<br/>
<br/>
Boss, that's Natalia on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what the f*ck is going on.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
Just don't say a word, brother.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] We need to put them each<br/>
in separate rooms.<br/>
<br/>
Fercho. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
To the right.<br/>
<br/>
This is messed up, man.<br/>
<br/>
- If your dad's still inside...<br/>
- Just drive the f*cking car.<br/>
<br/>
[Jorge in English]<br/>
I'm just trying to do my f*cking job.<br/>
<br/>
- Where is he?<br/>
- I don't know. Gotta be hiding somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
- Gotta be a caleta.<br/>
- Where?<br/>
<br/>
- I don't know.<br/>
- Help us. We're running out of time.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know this f*cking place.<br/>
I've never been here before.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the floor plan.<br/>
I don't know anything. This is new.<br/>
<br/>
Wait.<br/>
<br/>
Get back out there.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck! Okay. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Wait. I need you to hit me first.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
What we know is that agents of the DEA<br/>
<br/>
burst into the building this morning,<br/>
<br/>
just before dawn...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what did Salcedo say?<br/>
<br/>
Salcedo! What did he say?<br/>
<br/>
Sir, the thing is...<br/>
no one's heard from him.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Go to his house and check<br/>
what the f*ck he's doing<br/>
<br/>
that's more important than this. Please.<br/>
<br/>
Bye. Bye.<br/>
<br/>
[reporter] There's a surreal atmosphere<br/>
outside the San Jardín building.<br/>
<br/>
While curiosity is growing<br/>
about the operation<br/>
<br/>
and this has grabbed<br/>
the attention of the city,<br/>
<br/>
it isn't clear who the target<br/>
of the operation is.<br/>
<br/>
- Think he made it to another floor?<br/>
- No, I think he changed the one he's on.<br/>
<br/>
Good morning, ma'am.<br/>
We need to get into your apartment.<br/>
<br/>
[porro music playing]<br/>
<br/>
Help me.<br/>

- Lift.<br/>

Pretty sure the door upstairs<br/>
didn't close properly.<br/>

<br/>
- It fell over.<br/>
- It fell over?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, in a way, it did.<br/>
<br/>
Check this out.<br/>

Come on, there's something we gotta do.<br/>
<br/>
[instructor in Spanish]<br/>
Try to control the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's go.<br/>
<br/>
The f*ck's practicing<br/>
his backhand.<br/>
<br/>
[instructor]<br/>
That's it. Try to control it.<br/>
<br/>
- Hey! You bastard!<br/>
- Hey, fellas. Where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
- We're in the middle...<br/>
- Who are you talking to, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
We're in the middle of a lesson here.<br/>
<br/>
Who are you talking to?<br/>
<br/>
Why the f*ck is there a raid going on<br/>
at my dad's house,<br/>
<br/>
while you're here having tennis lessons?<br/>
<br/>
David, I don't know what<br/>
you're talking about. I don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to go<br/>
and help my f*cking dad. Now! Understood?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
- Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Go on. Quickly. What were you saying?<br/>
<br/>
It's fine.<br/>
<br/>
p*ssy.<br/>
<br/>
[Feistl]What exactly am I looking for?<br/>
<br/>
This area downstairs<br/>
measures in at 108 inches.<br/>
<br/>
Guys, I'm reading 84.<br/>
<br/>
Can you set me up?<br/>

You guys can't tear down that wall.<br/>
You don't have authorization.<br/>
<br/>
What are you going to do to stop us?<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
There's an air space back there.<br/>
<br/>
[groans]<br/>
<br/>
[breathing heavily]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
- [in Spanish] Stop what you're doing.<br/>
- [in English] We've been over this.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] As head<br/>
of the Attorney General's office in Cali,<br/>
<br/>
I have to insist<br/>
you put down that hammer right now.<br/>
<br/>
You're currently in violation<br/>
of Article 22 of the...<br/>
<br/>
[in English]<br/>
What's that? Arresting a fugitive?<br/>
<br/>
- [Peña] Chris.<br/>
- No, f*ck that!<br/>
<br/>
Miguel Rodríguez is right here.<br/>
Inside this wall.<br/>
<br/>
And you've broken the law.<br/>
<br/>
[chatter over radio]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
As the legal authority in this room...<br/>
<br/>
I demand that you cease and desist<br/>
your search of the premises immediately.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Put it down. We're done here.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Yes, and I'll need<br/>
your documentation from the embassy.<br/>
<br/>
Your passports.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Your passports.<br/>
<br/>
- You gotta be f*cking kidding me.<br/>
- Give him your passport, Chris.<br/>
<br/>
[Sergio in Spanish] I'm filing<br/>
an official complaint against each of you.<br/>
<br/>
[male reporter]<br/>
It has now been confirmed that the search<br/>
<br/>
of the San Jardín building<br/>
has been abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Agents from the DEA,<br/>
along with the Colombian special forces,<br/>
<br/>
have been seen leaving the building.<br/>
<br/>
We can now confirm<br/>
that the target of this investigation<br/>
<br/>
was in fact cartel godfather<br/>
Miguel Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
With the search now over<br/>
and no arrest made,<br/>
<br/>
questions regarding the actions of the DEA<br/>
and the credibility of their sources<br/>
<br/>
will surely arise.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a frenetic morning here<br/>
<br/>
as a great number of police officers<br/>
exited the building.<br/>
<br/>
The official word from the National Police<br/>
is the search has been abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Now the question is, what evidence<br/>
did the DEA have to run this operation?<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. Embassy<br/>
hasn't released a statement yet.<br/>
<br/>
[elevator dings]<br/>
<br/>
[Feistl in English] Thanks for having<br/>
our backs there, boss.<br/>
<br/>
[Van Ness] Keep our eyes on the building.<br/>
No way Miguel leaves here tonight.<br/>
<br/>
And wherever he goes, we follow his ass.<br/>
<br/>
We're on a plane to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Meet Crosby tonight,<br/>
Defense Minister in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
He makes the call on our visas.<br/>
<br/>
It's over.<br/>
<br/>
We f*cked up.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] It's all good.<br/>
<br/>
He's in front of me.<br/>
I'm about to tell him.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I just talked to Manny.<br/>
They've left the apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe<br/>
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.<br/>
<br/>
- Right.<br/>
- Just make sure. You hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
[breathing heavily]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
[gasps]<br/>
<br/>
[whimpers]<br/>
<br/>
[in English] What about my family?<br/>
What happens to them?<br/>
<br/>
- You need to get them out.<br/>
- [Feistl] I know.<br/>
<br/>
I put their lives in your hands.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we're being recalled to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Bogotá?<br/>
<br/>
They're gonna know<br/>
someone gave up the location.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on the inside.<br/>
If you leave, I'm a d*ad man.<br/>
<br/>
You gave me your f*cking word.<br/>
<br/>
We'll figure this out.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
[Miguel in Spanish] Hello?<br/>
<br/>
[exhales]<br/>
<br/>
They almost had you today, brother.<br/>
<br/>
- They didn't, Gilberto.<br/>
- Thank God.<br/>
<br/>
It's a miracle you got away.<br/>
<br/>
You need to revise your security network.<br/>
<br/>
Bring this to an end, brother.<br/>
<br/>
You have to embrace<br/>
that this is the reality we've built.<br/>
<br/>
It's what's best for all.<br/>
<br/>
Accept it, before it's too late.<br/>
<br/>
You, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
The reality you built.<br/>
<br/>
And where the f*ck has it gotten you?<br/>
<br/>
You're upset, brother. I get it.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm pretty f*cking pissed.<br/>
<br/>
Then listen to me. Embrace it.<br/>
<br/>
Look, everything we have,<br/>
everything we've ever built,<br/>
<br/>
is because of the decisions I've made.<br/>
<br/>
Our best strategy is non-v*olence.<br/>
<br/>
The best option we have is surrender.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
That was just a dream<br/>
you fell in love with.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't mine.<br/>

It takes balls, I'll give him that.<br/>

<br/>
You can appreciate<br/>
needing to show them off.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
You again with those trucks?<br/>
<br/>
I have orders to follow.<br/>
<br/>
And I have new orders.<br/>

I don't like it,<br/>
this disagreement between them.<br/>

Doesn't feel right.<br/>

It isn't us.<br/>

Maybe.<br/>

But times are changing.<br/>

Follow me!<br/>

- I'm not worried.<br/>
<br/>
[grunts]<br/>
<br/>
Makes you wish you were out there.<br/>
<br/>
[groans]<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know she doesn't want<br/>
to talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
That's why she's not f*cking home.<br/>
<br/>
But it's important I talk to her.<br/>
Understood?<br/>
<br/>
[man] Look, I don't know what's going on<br/>
between you guys, but she's upset.<br/>
<br/>
Pass her the f*cking phone now!<br/>
<br/>
No, Jorge. Give her some space.<br/>
<br/>
She'll call you when she's ready.<br/>

[priest in Spanish]
On the road from Galilee,

Christ came upon a beggar
who had thrice been denied alms.

Christ asked him if he'd taken before
that which wasn't his.

""Yes,"" the man said.

He'd taken what he felt hadn't been given.

Christ asked him...

- [clears throat]
- [""This Is How We Do It"" playing]

[speaking louder] Christ asked him
where had it left him...

- [g*n]
- [screaming]

[g*n cocking]

[""This Is How We Do It"" blaring]

Give him some.

[music stops]

Boss, I think I know whose car this is.

[grunting]

[whimpering]

[thumps]

[screaming]

[baby crying]

My name is Pacho Herrera.

I want Gerda Salazar
and her f*cking sons delivered to me.

Until that happens,
nobody in the North Valley is safe.

Is that clear?

Make sure Orlando Henao gets the message.

And now...

pray.

Pray.

[theme music playing]

[police sirens]

[g*n]

[Peña in English]
w*r had returned to Colombia.

Cocaine cartels are about succession.

The number two guys realize that
the number one guys are on their way out.

So they decide to speed things up.

With Gilberto Rodríguez in jail,
there was blood in the water.

And blood begets more blood.

I told you that Cali ran their empire
like a business.

Well, when your business gets too big,
you start selling franchises.

Cali basically allowed tr*ffick
who would normally be their rivals

to work under the umbrella
of their political protection...

to use their cocaine distribution network

and to take advantage of their muscle
when shit got heavy.

In return, they demanded loyalty
and a hefty cut of the profits.

And for a long time, that was cool.

But as brilliant
as Cali's surrender plan was,

it didn't take into account that
nobody wants to retire in second place.

North Valley cartel
was ready for first place.

tr*ffick like Iván Urdinola...

Henry Loaiza,

Gerda Salazar,

and the North Valley boss, Orlando Henao.

They didn't need to retire.

They controlled not only
the rural North Valley,

but the port of Buenaventura,

from which most of the world's
cocaine shipped.

It was the jewel in their crown.

And they did business...
differently than Cali.

[screaming]

Let's just say they didn't give a shit
about public relations.

""f*ck the Gentlemen of Cali,""
they figured.

With the port and Cali's
current legal troubles,

they had a sh*t at taking over.

It is often said in organized crime...

[Miguel in Spanish]
...w*r is bad for business.

Unless it's won.

Buenaventura is in Henao's territory.

We have to get the port back
so we can maintain our delivery schedules.

You think that...

Can it be done?

Negotiating with the government,
and the f*cking surrender...

it all means one thing.

Our allies and enemies think we're weak.

My brother Gilberto
is responsible for that.

How's Alvaro?

What do you want me to say, Miguel?

The doctors still don't know
if his cock will ever work again.

He's 22 years old.

I swear to you, Pacho,
the Salazars will pay for that shit.

[in English] You know where Miguel is.
Why haven't you arrested him?

It's not that simple, Jorge.

This kind of operation
needs to be vetted, approved.

Wait a minute.
How many people know about this?

Very few. And nobody knows your name.

We're gonna arrest
Miguel Rodríguez, all right?

And you can put all this behind you.

- Can I ask what your plan is?
- Small team, just before dawn.

- When?
- Zero-four-hundred. Tomorrow.

Transpo's three trucks
coming from different directions...

No, that's not gonna work. Miguel has
rotating security around the building.

They see anything unusual,
a call goes out to Fercho Castillo.

That's Miguel's assistant.

They'll be out
before you get through the lobby.

So then help us find
a blind spot in the perimeter.

There's no blind spots.
These people are professional.

- What about if we hit at shift change?
- We overlap shifts because of that reason.

- [sighs]
- Guys!

That's it? That's the plan?

- [Van Ness clears throat]
- [Jorge] Christ.

Have your entire team take Carrera Diez.
Make a turn at Avenida Siete.

I'll post a man there
that's gonna let you guys through.

You're putting a lot of faith in this guy.
You sure we can count on him?

I'll be posted there,
but if you don't get Miguel,

they're gonna k*ll me.
Do you understand that?

- They're gonna k*ll my family, my kids.
- We're not gonna let that happen.

Next time we see you, we're putting you
and your family on a plane to America.

[Feistl] You're getting out.
Just like we promised.

[Peña] With Miguel Rodríguez in charge,

we're dealing
with a different kind of cartel.

Then maybe you
shouldn't have arrested his brother.

This operation could significantly impact
the cartel's day-to-day,

stop the bloodshed.

Based on information
you're unwilling to share.

- Well, due to the sensitivity...
- Yes, you've said.

But gentlemen, to ask me to sign off
on this operation blindly?

You haven't given me anything
other than a code name.

How much can you trust this informant...
""Natalia""?

Or is that too much to ask?

I understand your frustration.

But I've been assured
that this intelligence is viable.

If you won't tell me what you have,
then please, get to what you need.

- A small team. No more than ten men.
- Contact General Vargas.

- I'll authorize him to provide you one.
- Actually, sir,

we were hoping you would provide
somebody independent of General Vargas.

[clears throat] If you would
just indulge us this one request.

Shall I assume you have someone in mind?

General Serrano, sir.

Agente Peña...

another setback and I won't be able
to help you, nor will I want to.

The case for the surrender deal
will only be strengthened.

And you and your team will be gone.

I appreciate your honesty, sir.

Thank you, Minister.

[Peña]
Through intimidation and corruption...

the Cali Cartel had effectively taken much
of the Colombian National Police force...

MONASTERY OF EL CARMEN

...and bent them to its will.

But there was one force it couldn't bend:

a man named General José Serrano...

whose faith and integrity
were exactly what we needed.

[in Spanish] Agent Peña, nice to meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

[Peña in English]
Serrano took two things seriously:

his service to God...

and his belief in the rule of law.

He expected the same from his men.

For him, it began at an early age.

He was a campesino,
the son of a dirt farmer...

He had never owned a pair of shoes.

One day, a group of mounted policemen
rode into his village.

It reminded him of the holy knights
that he had read about,

religious warriors on a mission from God.

He knew then...

that he would be one of them.

He joined the force expecting
to find other like-minded men.

But instead, he found corruption.

From where he could, he rooted it out.

When he became chief
of his first small town,

he fired over two-thirds of the department
for being on the take...

ANTI-NARCOTIC POLICE

...declaring w*r on corrupt cops
and tr*ffick alike.

[Serrano in Spanish] I will put
in maximum effort, with all my soul,

into fighting corruption.

Because when there is corruption...

there is no procedure,
there is no peace of mind.

[Peña in English] Twenty years, numerous
failed assassination attempts later...

he was still waging his w*r.

By the book, of course.

[Serrano in Spanish]
This informant of yours,

is he close to Miguel Rodríguez?

He's provided us with Miguel's location.

That's why it's urgent we move now.

May take a miracle
to get this close again.

Only God creates miracles.

It's for us to use the tools he's bestowed
to resolve these matters.

Any chance God's bestowed the right men
to pull off this operation?

God has many soldiers.

Mine are honest men
who answer to higher powers than you or I.

I'm not concerned about them.
But I'm worried about other issues.

Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
has led to new stipulations.

From now on, any warrant I sign

has to be filed
with the local fiscale office in Cali.

Which the cartel will know about.

Possibly.

Truth is, your tactics
won't be allowed a second run.

Just have to find new ones, General.

Your men, General, where are they now?

Awaiting their orders.

The target is Miguel Rodríguez.

Our operation will succeed

because you fulfill your duty to your God

and to your country. Understood?

[all] Yes, sir!

The operation from a strategic
point of view is a nightmare.

There's a security perimeter.

As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,
the target knows we're inside.

Agent Feistl and I will be
right behind you, arriving by helicopter.

We'll land on the roof
and come in from above.

- We're going to box them in.
- [Peña] Yes.

We have an inside man.

He'll be posted right here,
giving us our best way in.

[Paola] Which one do you want?

- [Alma and Vera] This one!
- Okay. Perfect.

Girls, please get ready.

Paola... you can't do this.

- I'm taking the girls to my parents'.
- Paola, you can't do this.

Especially with what's going on
with the cartel.

What? What are you saying?

Are you telling me I can't protect
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?

No. What I'm saying is that we need
to act normal, like everything is fine.

Everything isn't fine, Jorge.
Everything isn't fine.

They could be watching you, me, the girls.

Miguel's become paranoid.
Do you understand?

I'll call you in a few days.
The girls will want to hear from you.

Paola. Please.

The Americans are going to try
to arrest Miguel.

I'm going to make sure they succeed.

Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.
You, me, the girls.

We're leaving Colombia.

Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?

Who told you our girls want to leave
the only home they've ever known?

So we need to disappear.
Is that your plan?

Explain to me again, I don't get it.

What happens if the Americans fail?

[scoffs]

Paola, please. Please... wait.

Don't leave.

We weren't poor, Jorge.

We always had choices.

This was your choice.

[Serrano] What about the warrant?

You still haven't filed the paperwork,

and I can't authorize this raid
without it.

We're bringing the fiscale with us.

Until we're on-site,
no one else knows the real target.

Arrest him quickly.

Because if word of this gets out,

they'll try to stop us
with everything they've got.

General...

General...

one more thing.

I'd like to ask you to remain in Bogotá.

Those are my men.
That's my signature on the warrant.

Which puts your name on the line, sir.

If anything goes wrong,
and we look like...

Like what? Like idiots?

It wouldn't be the first time,
as I understand it.

You don't trust me.

But you can't do this without me.

That's true,
but I know the system we're up against.

With your name on the warrant...

there's no doubt
the cartel's watching you.

As soon as you make the arrest,

I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodríguez
into custody when the press arrive.

I'll stay here praying for your success,
because there's no doubt...

it's your reputation now on the line.

[engine starts]

Hi, boss. What's going on?
Getting a little late for you, huh?

Just checking in.

You run those taps over in El Lido

- like I asked?
- [in English] Yes, sir.

- [in Spanish] Perfect.
- All right. Well done.

Enrique, why don't you take off
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?

Is this some kind of test?

Someone offers me a day off, I say yes.

My wife's been hounding me.

I could use a night away
from all of her questions, Enrique.

I'm glad I'm not married yet.

Don't make that mistake.

[laughs]

Thank you, boss.

[pager beeping]

It's Miguel.

Don't worry, boss.
I'll hang out until you get back.

Good.

[air traffic control chatter]

[indistinct chatter]

[elevator dings]

[knock on door]

Miguel's just finishing his call.
Come on in.

[Miguel] We can discuss that later.

He's here now.

Yes, you've said.

Bye.

My son.

You know how he is. A little...

complicated.

He is your son.

[chatter over radio]

[in English]
This the guy with the warrant?

[Feistl] Yeah, I think so.

Yeah.

Looks friendly.

Yeah, I don't give a shit,
as long as he does what he's told.

[Miguel in Spanish] Good things
are coming, Jorge. You'll be part of it.

I'm glad, sir. Is there anything else?

Take a seat.

You know that my brother...

he doesn't like this w*r thing.

He thinks it's a mistake,
being at w*r with the North Valley.

He said this brings too much tension,

with the v*olence and everything.

He's getting counsel from men
I don't trust at all.

Those phones that you...

how do you call it? Wiretaps?

Wiretap.

Do you think...

you could put one
on my brother's phone in prison?

You want me
to tap Gilberto's phone in prison?

Mm-hmm.

For his own good.

Only if it became necessary.

So... for him.

Of course, sir. Anything you need.

Good.

This stays here.

Of course, sir.

Well, I should get back downstairs.
I'm posted outside tonight.

You? Nonsense. You're too old for that!
[chuckles]

I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.

No. No way.
Have one of the young guys do it.

You know, I'm eating late.
Fercho was about to make something.

You'll join us.

You'll join us, Jorge.

Fercho! We will be two. Come.

[tires screeching]

[whirring]

[Fercho] Do you like filets, Jorge?

Yes, very much.

Hey, I've been meaning to tell you...

the building guys,
they've been idling in front of the house.

Blocking our exit.

You see that?
Feels good when one's been taken care of.

Yes. Keep your walkie charged.

And the exits clear.

Like you said.

You want one?

Yes, thanks.

Look,
I have a bottle of white wine that is...

Excuse me, boss, if it's not
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.

Okay. It's a shame, but... okay.

But I have a really nice bottle
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.

[chatter over radio]

[Fercho]
You're in for a treat tonight.

Miguel has me cooking
with these Japanese bread crumbs.

Sounds crazy,
but it's actually more tasty.

That's very interesting.

Hey, Fercho, looks like the oil's ready.

Yes.

Boss! Boss! Boss!

We have cars heading towards the building.
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...

Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.
This is a residence...

[in English] We have a warrant. Hey.

[in Spanish] A residence?

[in English] What?

[in Spanish] Hear that?

Enrique! What the f*ck is going on?

You didn't inform us
there's a helicopter?

- How the f*ck did they find us?!
- Sir, calm down.

We need to get you out of here now.
There's no time to discuss this.

- Miguel, what's happening?
- You need to hide.

Is there somewhere we can take you?
A caleta in the apartment?

Stop. Get to the lobby.
Get to the lobby and stop them.

It's better if he goes.
Every second counts.

Get to the lobby! Stop them.

María.

[whispers in English] No, no, no.

- Colombian law.
- No, but if he's got a caleta in there...

If you want anything we do in there
to count, follow the f*cking rules.

Van Ness. Where are you?

I need the fiscale upstairs.
Where the f*ck are you?

This isn't a financial building.

Miguel Rodríguez is upstairs.
We have the warrant.

Yes. Without an address filed in Cali.

So fill it in.

As I've told you, my office authorized
the search of a financial corporation.

[in Spanish] What the f*ck is this?

[in English] Hands in the air!

[elevator dings]

Look, sir, as I told your agent,
I can't do...

Write the address in right now.
That's why you're here.

You decide how you want this to go.

Okay.

- [in Spanish] Are you Fernando Castillo?
- What's all this?

We're here to arrest Miguel Rodríguez.

Miguel isn't here.

[man] There's nothing.

Look above.

Take that off!

[man 2] Cabinets!

There's nothing here.

Try the ones below.

[sirens blaring]

Who's in charge here?

I asked you a question.

I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorized
to let anyone inside.

You see this f*cking badge?

Your superiors failed to report
this operation with the local bureau.

I'd like to know
who'll be answering for that.

These are direct orders
from my superiors, sir.

Step out of my way.

Peinados, stay here.

Let's go!

[man] Move!

Sergeant, you copy?
The local police are heading up.

Go to the back, please.
You can sit on the couch.

[María] How long is this going to take?

[Van Ness] Chris.

[María] What are you doing?

Hey, kid. Where is he?
Was Miguel Rodríguez here?

Don't speak to my son.

Okay.

Can he please go to his room?
He's just a child.

- Is the room clear?
- Clear.

Okay, leave. Go ahead.

Flores.

- Who's in charge here?
- DEA.

I assume with Colombian support.

[scoffs]

I don't see a ranking officer.

Guess that puts me in charge.

There's an exit over there
that leads to the street.

Do you have anyone posted there?
Of course.

If you'd properly notified my unit,
we could have blocked that exit

- and prevented this escape.
- There's no evidence he got out.

That's why you're looking
through the kitchen cabinets?

[Dario] David!

[knocking on door]

David!

Wake up, man! We have to go.

Let go of her already.

[sniffs, groans]

Come on, man!

[in English] I think it's time
you call Natalia.

Find out what she's heard.

Um...

Boss, that's Natalia on the couch.

Find out what the f*ck is going on.

[in Spanish]
Just don't say a word, brother.

[in Spanish] We need to put them each
in separate rooms.

Fercho. Let's go.

To the right.

This is messed up, man.

- If your dad's still inside...
- Just drive the f*cking car.

[Jorge in English]
I'm just trying to do my f*cking job.

- Where is he?
- I don't know. Gotta be hiding somewhere.

- Gotta be a caleta.
- Where?

- I don't know.
- Help us. We're running out of time.

I don't know this f*cking place.
I've never been here before.

I don't know the floor plan.
I don't know anything. This is new.

Wait.

Get back out there.

f*ck! Okay. Come on.

Wait. I need you to hit me first.

[in Spanish]
What we know is that agents of the DEA

burst into the building this morning,

just before dawn...

Hey, what did Salcedo say?

Salcedo! What did he say?

Sir, the thing is...
no one's heard from him.

f*ck!

Do me a favor.

Go to his house and check
what the f*ck he's doing

that's more important than this. Please.

Bye. Bye.

[reporter] There's a surreal atmosphere
outside the San Jardín building.

While curiosity is growing
about the operation

and this has grabbed
the attention of the city,

it isn't clear who the target
of the operation is.

- Think he made it to another floor?
- No, I think he changed the one he's on.

Good morning, ma'am.
We need to get into your apartment.

[porro music playing]

Help me.

- Lift.
- Hold on.

Okay. One, two...

Having fun over there, Van Ness?

Pretty sure the door upstairs
didn't close properly.

What happened here?

- It fell over.
- It fell over?

I mean, in a way, it did.

Check this out.

Come on, there's something we gotta do.

[instructor in Spanish]
Try to control the wrist.

Okay, let's go.

The f*ck's practicing
his backhand.

[instructor]
That's it. Try to control it.

- Hey! You bastard!
- Hey, fellas. Where are you going?

- We're in the middle...
- Who are you talking to, f*ck?

We're in the middle of a lesson here.

Who are you talking to?

Why the f*ck is there a raid going on
at my dad's house,

while you're here having tennis lessons?

David, I don't know what
you're talking about. I don't understand.

You're going to go
and help my f*cking dad. Now! Understood?

- Yes.
- Let's go.

Go on. Quickly. What were you saying?

It's fine.

p*ssy.

[Feistl]What exactly am I looking for?

This area downstairs
measures in at 108 inches.

Guys, I'm reading 84.

Can you set me up?

- [man] Got the perfect sh*t.
- [woman] Pan towards the top.

[panting]

[whirring]

You guys can't tear down that wall.
You don't have authorization.

What are you going to do to stop us?

[in English] Let's go.

There's an air space back there.

[groans]

[breathing heavily]

[hammering]

- [in Spanish] Stop what you're doing.
- [in English] We've been over this.

[in Spanish] As head
of the Attorney General's office in Cali,

I have to insist
you put down that hammer right now.

You're currently in violation
of Article 22 of the...

[in English]
What's that? Arresting a fugitive?

- [Peña] Chris.
- No, f*ck that!

Miguel Rodríguez is right here.
Inside this wall.

And you've broken the law.

[chatter over radio]

[in Spanish]
As the legal authority in this room...

I demand that you cease and desist
your search of the premises immediately.

[in English] Put it down. We're done here.

[in Spanish] Yes, and I'll need
your documentation from the embassy.

Your passports.

[in English] Your passports.

- You gotta be f*cking kidding me.
- Give him your passport, Chris.

[Sergio in Spanish] I'm filing
an official complaint against each of you.

[male reporter]
It has now been confirmed that the search

of the San Jardín building
has been abandoned.

Agents from the DEA,
along with the Colombian special forces,

have been seen leaving the building.

We can now confirm
that the target of this investigation

was in fact cartel godfather
Miguel Rodríguez.

With the search now over
and no arrest made,

questions regarding the actions of the DEA
and the credibility of their sources

will surely arise.

It's been a frenetic morning here

as a great number of police officers
exited the building.

The official word from the National Police
is the search has been abandoned.

Now the question is, what evidence
did the DEA have to run this operation?

The U.S. Embassy
hasn't released a statement yet.

[elevator dings]

[Feistl in English] Thanks for having
our backs there, boss.

[Van Ness] Keep our eyes on the building.
No way Miguel leaves here tonight.

And wherever he goes, we follow his ass.

We're on a plane to Bogotá.

Meet Crosby tonight,
Defense Minister in the morning.

He makes the call on our visas.

It's over.

We f*cked up.

[sighs]

[in Spanish] It's all good.

He's in front of me.
I'm about to tell him.

Hey, I just talked to Manny.
They've left the apartment.

Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.

- Right.
- Just make sure. You hear me?

Sounds good.

[sighs]

Okay.

[breathing heavily]

[gasping]

[gasps]

[whimpers]

[in English] What about my family?
What happens to them?

- You need to get them out.
- [Feistl] I know.

I put their lives in your hands.

I'm sorry, Jorge.

Yeah, we're being recalled to Bogotá.

Bogotá?

They're gonna know
someone gave up the location.

Someone on the inside.
If you leave, I'm a d*ad man.

You gave me your f*cking word.

We'll figure this out.

f*ck.

[Miguel in Spanish] Hello?

[exhales]

They almost had you today, brother.

- They didn't, Gilberto.
- Thank God.

It's a miracle you got away.

You need to revise your security network.

Bring this to an end, brother.

You have to embrace
that this is the reality we've built.

It's what's best for all.

Accept it, before it's too late.

You, Gilberto.

The reality you built.

And where the f*ck has it gotten you?

You're upset, brother. I get it.

Yeah, I'm pretty f*cking pissed.

Then listen to me. Embrace it.

Look, everything we have,
everything we've ever built,

is because of the decisions I've made.

Our best strategy is non-v*olence.

The best option we have is surrender.

I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.

That was just a dream
you fell in love with.

It isn't mine.

Miguel.

[clattering]

[grunts]

[cumbia music playing]

[Chepe]
It takes balls, I'll give him that.

Balls I wasn't sure he had.

You can appreciate
needing to show them off.

[chuckles]

You again with those trucks?

I have orders to follow.

And I have new orders.

[g*n cocks]

I don't like it,
this disagreement between them.

Doesn't feel right.

It isn't us.

Maybe.

But times are changing.

[man] Let's go!

Follow me!

[shattering]

[grunting]

[g*n]

Everything is going to be okay, brother.

- Don't you worry.
- I'm not worried.

[grunts]

Makes you wish you were out there.

[groans]

Yes, I know she doesn't want
to talk to me.

That's why she's not f*cking home.

But it's important I talk to her.
Understood?

[man] Look, I don't know what's going on
between you guys, but she's upset.

Pass her the f*cking phone now!

No, Jorge. Give her some space.

She'll call you when she's ready.

option, you're free to take it.<br/>
<br/>
I need to think about this.<br/>
<br/>
Still didn't catch your name.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge. Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
[EXHALES]<br/>
<br/>
[CAR DOOR THUMPS]<br/>
<br/>
I think we found a gold mine.<br/>
<br/>
Guy says he's head of security for<br/>
the cartel and he wants to roll?<br/>
<br/>
They don't call it the Cali<br/>
KGB for nothing, Chris.<br/>
<br/>
Let's get the f*ck out of here.<br/>
<br/>
[ENGINE TURNS OVER]<br/>
<br/>
[PEÑA]Franklin Jurado.<br/>
<br/>
One testimony from him and he can<br/>
take down the entire Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
He travels on multiple passports.<br/>
<br/>
So, he gets on a flight, we lose<br/>
him who the f*ck knows where.<br/>
<br/>
I need him on a plane today so that<br/>
he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
[IN PAPIAMENTO] Okay, listen up.<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] We'll provide<br/>
Agent Peña and his men<br/>
<br/>
with any support they require.<br/>
<br/>
[IN PAPIAMENTO] Understood?<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] Okay, typically, he<br/>
goes to a cooperative credit bank<br/>
<br/>
and then has breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
- We sit on it and get him there.<br/>
- Hey, hey.<br/>
<br/>
You plan to take him at the bank?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot do that, Agent Peña.<br/>
<br/>
[PEÑA] Here's what you need<br/>
to know about Curaçao.<br/>
<br/>
It's a smuggler's paradise.<br/>
<br/>
And for the Cali cartel, you<br/>
can't b*at the location.<br/>
<br/>
Only 40 miles separates South<br/>
American coast from Curaçaon ports,<br/>
<br/>
prized for centuries by smugglers,<br/>
slave traders, and now cartels.<br/>
<br/>
Cruise ships filled with old people<br/>
next to speed boats filled with cash.<br/>
<br/>
And what doesn't get smuggled through,<br/>
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.<br/>
<br/>
Way back, some enterprising Dutchmen<br/>
<br/>
set up a financial system<br/>
cloaked in old-world secrecy.<br/>
<br/>
Their economy is so dependent on<br/>
money launderers parking their cash,<br/>
<br/>
that you can make an arrest,<br/>
just not at or near a bank.<br/>
<br/>
DI STREA BANK CURAÇAO<br/>
<br/>
Of course, where do you think<br/>
Franklin spent most of his time?<br/>
<br/>
All right, we tail him. And then we<br/>
catch him somewhere that suits us both.<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah. Thank you.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's go.<br/>
<br/>
[JORGE IN SPANISH] Good<br/>
morning, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
[ALL] Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
As many of you know,<br/>
<br/>
since Córdova's resignation,<br/>
I am the head of security.<br/>
<br/>
It's festival time. That means<br/>
the city will be crowded.<br/>
<br/>
The festival is not an<br/>
excuse to party on the job.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing. David and his team will<br/>
now be handling security for his father.<br/>
<br/>
Let's make them feel welcome.<br/>
<br/>
And help them any way you can.<br/>
<br/>
That's all, boys. Get going!<br/>
<br/>
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Look at you. You're sliding<br/>
into your new job like a glove.<br/>
<br/>
You're a natural.<br/>
<br/>
Look, David, if we're going to work<br/>
together, we need to cooperate.<br/>
<br/>
Mm...<br/>
<br/>
If you have questions or you want to<br/>
talk about your father's security...<br/>
<br/>
I'm here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
How come none of your men<br/>
carry f*cking g*n? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Because we use our walkies<br/>
if we have a problem.<br/>
<br/>
For what? To say goodbye<br/>
when you're getting clipped?<br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
You do your thing, I'll do mine.<br/>
All right?<br/>
<br/>
Boss, you didn't mention the<br/>
DEA agents that are in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
That's something David<br/>
might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, the last thing we need<br/>
right now is David and his crew<br/>
<br/>
k*ll a federal agent, no?<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's true.<br/>
<br/>
For now, we'll monitor<br/>
the DEA ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Besides... I doubt they have much.<br/>
<br/>
[AMPARO CRYING]<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
- [SOBS] Why, Chepe?<br/>
- My love...<br/>
<br/>
I know you don't want to<br/>
leave New York. I know.<br/>
<br/>
I don't either.<br/>
<br/>
But if they connect this lab to us...<br/>
<br/>
we're going to have every<br/>
cop in the city after us.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, look.<br/>
<br/>
Here it comes.<br/>
<br/>
Spokesmen for the DEA say that the<br/>
cocaine lab that exploded in Queens<br/>
<br/>
was operated by a Dominican g*ng.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly! Thank you, lady.<br/>
f*cking Dominicans!<br/>
<br/>
But Manuel de Dios, editor of La Prensa,<br/>
<br/>
has discovered another<br/>
side to the story.<br/>
<br/>
This lab, along with a number<br/>
of others in the area,<br/>
<br/>
was recently seized by<br/>
Colombian gangsters,<br/>
<br/>
led by a man going by<br/>
the name Victor Crespo.<br/>
<br/>
- f*ck.<br/>
- In the next few days,<br/>
<br/>
we will be publishing<br/>
an investigative series<br/>
<br/>
about this criminal enterprise,<br/>
including pictures.<br/>
<br/>
This operation is much<br/>
larger than it seems.<br/>
<br/>
""No speak Spanish"" my ass.<br/>
<br/>
So that means we have<br/>
to leave, right, Chepe?<br/>
<br/>
No, my love.<br/>
<br/>
This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Is that so?<br/>
<br/>
So do me a favor and fix this.<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
[MIGUEL] So a new surrender deal.<br/>
<br/>
[NICOLÁS] Three years in jail.<br/>
All of you.<br/>
<br/>
Turn in the illicit businesses, and<br/>
we can keep all of the legal assets,<br/>
<br/>
as in the old plan. It's a good deal.<br/>
<br/>
He would've told you himself,<br/>
<br/>
but he thought it was best<br/>
for me to explain in person.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.<br/>
<br/>
I understand. Thank you<br/>
for coming, Nicolás.<br/>
<br/>
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
An update?<br/>
<br/>
On our efforts to maximize<br/>
business before surrender.<br/>
<br/>
So I can inform my father.<br/>
<br/>
Tell your dad everything's<br/>
still on track here.<br/>
<br/>
Pacho's settled new terms<br/>
with Amado Carrillo Fuentes<br/>
<br/>
and is coming back soon.<br/>
<br/>
And this accident in New York?<br/>
<br/>
Chepe encountered an obstacle,<br/>
but you know Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not worried.<br/>
<br/>
Are we done?<br/>
<br/>
One last thing.<br/>
<br/>
Our friends in Bogotá are<br/>
concerned about their exposure.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people know about the deal.<br/>
<br/>
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
My father would like you to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
""Handle it""?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what you're talking about?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any idea?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
<br/>
Pallomari's our chief accountant<br/>
in Cali, and not easily replaced.<br/>
<br/>
He's too valuable to just k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
Tell your father I'll take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't have to<br/>
worry about Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
<br/>
So now the little prince<br/>
is giving you orders?<br/>
<br/>
His father's orders.<br/>
<br/>
Have Salcedo put Pallomari<br/>
in one of the safe houses.<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye on him.<br/>
<br/>
You decide if you're coming tonight?<br/>
<br/>
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
It's important.<br/>
<br/>
You know how I feel about parties.<br/>
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
Which is exactly why you should go.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, you're the new boss here.<br/>
<br/>
Please, show them.<br/>
<br/>
Or at least have a good time before<br/>
we have to roll over and play d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
[PEÑA] Now why would a Cali<br/>
godfather come out of hiding<br/>
<br/>
and risk getting captured?<br/>
<br/>
Because what good is being<br/>
the king if nobody knows it?<br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing to come out of<br/>
Cali wasn't cocaine. It was salsa.<br/>
<br/>
And every year, the two combined<br/>
at the annual Feria de Cali,<br/>
<br/>
a week-long extravaganza of<br/>
parties and salsa concerts.<br/>
<br/>
And the man who always presided<br/>
over the opening-night festivities?<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] Cheers, gentlemen!<br/>
<br/>
[PEÑA] But with him in jail,<br/>
it was time for a new king.<br/>
<br/>
[IN SPANISH] How would you<br/>
like to be my date tonight?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...<br/>
<br/>
Where would we go?<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
♪ Let's go dancing ♪<br/>
<br/>
Do you like dancing?<br/>
<br/>
[JORGE]As discussed with Don Miguel,<br/>
he'd like you to keep working from here.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know what needs to be done.<br/>
<br/>
Come in.<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo, what's this? You've<br/>
got to be kidding, right?<br/>
<br/>
- You're playing me for a fool.<br/>
- What's this?<br/>
<br/>
This is unacceptable. I<br/>
need to speak to Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to whoever you want. This is the<br/>
biggest apartment we have right now.<br/>
<br/>
- Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.<br/>
- Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
A/C. Kids seem to like it.<br/>
<br/>
- Kids, do you like it?<br/>
- Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Really, Patricia. You<br/>
going to smoke inside?<br/>
<br/>
What's the problem? This is a dump.<br/>
<br/>
The boys are here.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, now you're concerned about the boys?<br/>
<br/>
Do not leave this apartment,<br/>
for your own safety.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you've done for these people,<br/>
and this is how they repay you?<br/>
<br/>
[IN ENGLISH] Yeah. Got it.<br/>
Thanks, Stoddard.<br/>
<br/>
All right, last hit Duffy<br/>
and López had on Salcedo,<br/>
<br/>
he was deputy chief of<br/>
security for the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
All right. So that much is true.<br/>
<br/>
Had a degree in engineering.<br/>
<br/>
Business license for a bio-diesel<br/>
factory that went belly-up.<br/>
<br/>
- Wonder why.<br/>
- Ex-military.<br/>
<br/>
Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.<br/>
<br/>
Who became head of<br/>
security for the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Must have been how he got the job.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if he clipped his old<br/>
buddy to take his spot.<br/>
<br/>
And he was connected to the purchase<br/>
of b*mb in a plan to k*ll Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, just that?<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound like the<br/>
everyman who only signed on<br/>
<br/>
- to protect Miguel's family to you?<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,<br/>
he's our best bet to get Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Scumbags I can handle. What<br/>
I don't like are liars.<br/>
<br/>
So when he calls back<br/>
with Miguel's location...<br/>
<br/>
- how you want to play it?<br/>
- If he calls at all,<br/>
<br/>
we ask the hard questions,<br/>
see how he holds up.<br/>
<br/>
[HENAO IN SPANISH] I'm<br/>
telling you, they're done.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto's looking for<br/>
some new way to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
And you heard about this thing<br/>
in New York with Chepe, right?<br/>
<br/>
And Miguel's in charge<br/>
of everything here.<br/>
<br/>
Better said, the Cali cartel is d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
[AMADO] And you intend to...?<br/>
<br/>
To do whatever I have to do<br/>
for the North Valley cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I'm talking to you.<br/>
<br/>
[SNIFFING]<br/>
<br/>
It's funny how things change, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
So, Amado... what do you say?<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS]<br/>
<br/>
I say you're no f*cking<br/>
fun, that's what I say.<br/>
<br/>
But we both see the future the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Look, starting next week...<br/>
<br/>
I'll only be shipping product for<br/>
my new North Valley friends. Good?<br/>
<br/>
And what about the other<br/>
thing we discussed?<br/>
<br/>
[SNIFFS]<br/>
<br/>
[DAVID] Look, I need<br/>
you to make room here.<br/>
<br/>
And I want you to take care of the<br/>
guests, get them everything they need.<br/>
<br/>
I also want a bottle at<br/>
each of these tables.<br/>
<br/>
But I want the good stuff. None<br/>
of that shit you serve here.<br/>

Leave your bitch down here.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS]<br/>
<br/>
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about what you said...<br/>
<br/>
if I ever need your advice, and...<br/>
<br/>
I could use your help.<br/>
<br/>
With your father's security.<br/>
<br/>
He's coming to the party tonight.<br/>
<br/>
He's coming here?<br/>
<br/>
Unless there's another f*cking party<br/>
I don't know about? Yeah, here.<br/>
<br/>
What do you want me to tell you, David?<br/>
<br/>
Public places are always bad.<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people.<br/>
<br/>
When does he plan on arriving?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking around 11:00.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what f*cking time is best, then?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think ten is better.<br/>
<br/>
It's less crowded. Maybe I can<br/>
take him up to the balcony.<br/>
<br/>
You'll take care of it?<br/>

I knew I could count on you.<br/>

it isn't a good idea?<br/>

check this, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
No. You're gonna have to trust me.<br/>

why you would call us the<br/>
day after you get a raise.<br/>

<br/>
Julia said you might have...<br/>
something on Crespo?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes.<br/>
<br/>
It's something I hope you like.<br/>
<br/>
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?<br/>
<br/>
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCKLES] Well...<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping I could help you.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you from?<br/>
<br/>
- Cuba.<br/>
- Cuba! Gorgeous.<br/>
<br/>
When you were young,<br/>
<br/>
did you ever think you would come to<br/>
this country and do something special?<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCKLES]<br/>
<br/>
Well, I did.<br/>
<br/>
I imagined myself coming here to<br/>
the United States, to New York...<br/>
<br/>
and building something important.<br/>
<br/>
That was also my dream.<br/>
<br/>
The dream of a young<br/>
immigrant, like yourself.<br/>
<br/>
And that's why I want to help you, to<br/>
make whatever dream you have a reality.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless how much it costs.<br/>
<br/>
In dollars.<br/>
<br/>
You think you and I are the same<br/>
<br/>
because we came to this<br/>
country with dreams?<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
My family fled Cuba because<br/>
we believed in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
You came to sell cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we are both immigrants,<br/>
<br/>
but we have nothing in common, Mr.<br/>
Santacruz.<br/>
<br/>
My story is going to print.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Thank you for hearing my proposal.<br/>
<br/>
Can I ask you a question?<br/>
<br/>
How long will it take to get<br/>
to the airport from here?<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
An hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
[CHEPE LAUGHS]<br/>
<br/>
I'll miss a lot about New York.<br/>
<br/>
But not the traffic.<br/>

[PORRO MUSIC PLAYING]</div>]","[PEÑA IN ENGLISH] The Cali cartel
is an almost-perfect organism.

Even though we had cut off its head,
the body kept right on going,

making and selling cocaine.

They stuck to the plan.

And for a long time, that
plan had worked for them.

[IN SPANISH] The guy is innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

Easy, honey, easy, okay? Be careful.

The glove.

Screw the f*cking glove, brother.

- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an assh*le.

- And he's been f*cking the sister.
- Which one?

The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is f*cking her, too.

[PEÑA IN ENGLISH] But
no plan is perfect.

Especially when you deal with a
substance as volatile as cocaine.

At some point... you're
gonna make a mistake.

And your enemies are
watching and waiting.

They're gonna see your
weakness and make a move.

See, that's the thing about plans.

No matter how perfect
you think they are...

however brilliant or
audacious they may be...

well, they can still go to shit
when that one thing goes wrong.

- [GLASS SHATTERING]
- [SCREAMING]

And once that happens,
there's no going back.

It's all downhill from there.

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

[SIGHS]

Oh, hey, hey.

[FEISTL] Think that's him?

[VAN NESS] Has to be.

[ENGINE RUMBLING]

[GEARS CHANGING]

Let's go.

[VAN NESS] Close enough.

Lift up your shirt. Turn around.

[IN ENGLISH] I'm unarmed.

Approach slowly, hands out.

- You told nobody about this?
- [VAN NESS] Nobody.

- And you weren't followed?
- We're clean.

You headed north to Yumbo
instead of east from Cali.

And then straight on to Rozo.

I had to make sure you are who you
say you are. That you're alone.

Get in the car.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're in the front seat.

I'm Chris Feistl. This is Daniel...

Daniel Van Ness. I know your names.

What about yours?

I don't want to be here
more than two minutes.

This is the only time we're
gonna speak face-to-face.

So you said you work for
the Rodríguez brothers.

I'm the chief of security
for the Cali cartel.

- You're the head of security?
- Yes.

I have valuable information for you.

In exchange, I want safe passage for
my family and myself to the States.

Once there, with full immunity,
I'll help you in any way I can.

Listen, here's the thing, man. You're
head of security for the cartel.

You have a lot more to offer
us than just testimony.

Like Miguel Rodríguez.

Is that gonna be a problem?

Besides the fact that we're
all gonna end up d*ad?

There's a security
system that I designed.

Safe houses, lookouts on every corner,

a radio communication system.

- We can work around all that.
- Maybe.

Then there's David, Miguel's son.

He personally controls his
father's security now.

- I don't even know where he is.
- But you can find out.

And if I do? The police? The military?

You can't trust them. I pay them.

We can get guys we trust, all right?
Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it? [CHUCKLES]

No. I'll testify. That's it.

Let me ask you something. Why are
you doing this? Talking to us?

I'm not a m*rder. I'm not like them.
I want to get my family out.

Well, we'd love to help
you with that, but...

we can't do that unless
you give us Miguel.

[VAN NESS] And honestly, we
don't need your testimony.

Bottom line, you have a better
option, you're free to take it.

I need to think about this.

Still didn't catch your name.

Jorge. Salcedo.

[EXHALES]

[CAR DOOR THUMPS]

I think we found a gold mine.

Guy says he's head of security for
the cartel and he wants to roll?

They don't call it the Cali
KGB for nothing, Chris.

Let's get the f*ck out of here.

[ENGINE TURNS OVER]

[PEÑA]Franklin Jurado.

One testimony from him and he can
take down the entire Cali cartel.

He travels on multiple passports.

So, he gets on a flight, we lose
him who the f*ck knows where.

I need him on a plane today so that
he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.

[IN PAPIAMENTO] Okay, listen up.

[IN ENGLISH] We'll provide
Agent Peña and his men

with any support they require.

[IN PAPIAMENTO] Understood?

[IN ENGLISH] Okay, typically, he
goes to a cooperative credit bank

and then has breakfast.

- We sit on it and get him there.
- Hey, hey.

You plan to take him at the bank?

Mm-hmm.

You cannot do that, Agent Peña.

[PEÑA] Here's what you need
to know about Curaçao.

It's a smuggler's paradise.

And for the Cali cartel, you
can't b*at the location.

Only 40 miles separates South
American coast from Curaçaon ports,

prized for centuries by smugglers,
slave traders, and now cartels.

Cruise ships filled with old people
next to speed boats filled with cash.

And what doesn't get smuggled through,
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.

Way back, some enterprising Dutchmen

set up a financial system
cloaked in old-world secrecy.

Their economy is so dependent on
money launderers parking their cash,

that you can make an arrest,
just not at or near a bank.

DI STREA BANK CURAÇAO

Of course, where do you think
Franklin spent most of his time?

All right, we tail him. And then we
catch him somewhere that suits us both.

- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

Okay, let's go.

[JORGE IN SPANISH] Good
morning, gentlemen.

[ALL] Good morning.

As many of you know,

since Córdova's resignation,
I am the head of security.

It's festival time. That means
the city will be crowded.

The festival is not an
excuse to party on the job.

One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

Let's make them feel welcome.

And help them any way you can.

That's all, boys. Get going!

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Wow. Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

You're a natural.

Look, David, if we're going to work
together, we need to cooperate.

Mm...

If you have questions or you want to
talk about your father's security...

I'm here.

Thank you.

I do have a question, Jorge.

How come none of your men
carry f*cking g*n? Huh?

Because we use our walkies
if we have a problem.

For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

Do me a favor, Jorge.

You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

Boss, you didn't mention the
DEA agents that are in Cali.

That's something David
might be interested in.

Listen, the last thing we need
right now is David and his crew

k*ll a federal agent, no?

Well, that's true.

For now, we'll monitor
the DEA ourselves.

Besides... I doubt they have much.

[AMPARO CRYING]

I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

- [SOBS] Why, Chepe?
- My love...

I know you don't want to
leave New York. I know.

I don't either.

But if they connect this lab to us...

we're going to have every
cop in the city after us.

Hey, look.

Here it comes.

Spokesmen for the DEA say that the
cocaine lab that exploded in Queens

was operated by a Dominican g*ng.

Exactly! Thank you, lady.
f*cking Dominicans!

But Manuel de Dios, editor of La Prensa,

has discovered another
side to the story.

This lab, along with a number
of others in the area,

was recently seized by
Colombian gangsters,

led by a man going by
the name Victor Crespo.

- f*ck.
- In the next few days,

we will be publishing
an investigative series

about this criminal enterprise,
including pictures.

This operation is much
larger than it seems.

""No speak Spanish"" my ass.

So that means we have
to leave, right, Chepe?

No, my love.

This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.

Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

Is that so?

So do me a favor and fix this.

Did you hear me?

f*ck.

[MIGUEL] So a new surrender deal.

[NICOLÁS] Three years in jail.
All of you.

Turn in the illicit businesses, and
we can keep all of the legal assets,

as in the old plan. It's a good deal.

He would've told you himself,

but he thought it was best
for me to explain in person.

Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

I understand. Thank you
for coming, Nicolás.

Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

An update?

On our efforts to maximize
business before surrender.

So I can inform my father.

Tell your dad everything's
still on track here.

Pacho's settled new terms
with Amado Carrillo Fuentes

and is coming back soon.

And this accident in New York?

Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

I'm not worried.

Are we done?

One last thing.

Our friends in Bogotá are
concerned about their exposure.

Too many people know about the deal.

They worry about Mr. Pallomari.

My father would like you to handle it.

""Handle it""?

Do you know what you're talking about?

Do you have any idea?

Hmm?

Pallomari's our chief accountant
in Cali, and not easily replaced.

He's too valuable to just k*ll.

Tell your father I'll take care of it.

He doesn't have to
worry about Pallomari.

Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

Take care.

So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

His father's orders.

Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

Keep an eye on him.

You decide if you're coming tonight?

Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.

It's important.

You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

Which is exactly why you should go.

Dad, you're the new boss here.

Please, show them.

Or at least have a good time before
we have to roll over and play d*ad.

[PEÑA] Now why would a Cali
godfather come out of hiding

and risk getting captured?

Because what good is being
the king if nobody knows it?

The biggest thing to come out of
Cali wasn't cocaine. It was salsa.

And every year, the two combined
at the annual Feria de Cali,

a week-long extravaganza of
parties and salsa concerts.

And the man who always presided
over the opening-night festivities?

Gilberto Rodríguez.

[IN SPANISH] Cheers, gentlemen!

[PEÑA] But with him in jail,
it was time for a new king.

[IN SPANISH] How would you
like to be my date tonight?

Hmm...

Where would we go?

Come here.

♪ Let's go dancing ♪

Do you like dancing?

[JORGE]As discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

Yes, I know what needs to be done.

Come in.

Guillermo, what's this? You've
got to be kidding, right?

- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

This is unacceptable. I
need to speak to Miguel.

Talk to whoever you want. This is the
biggest apartment we have right now.

- Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.
- Uh-huh.

A/C. Kids seem to like it.

- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

Really, Patricia. You
going to smoke inside?

What's the problem? This is a dump.

The boys are here.

Oh, now you're concerned about the boys?

Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

[IN ENGLISH] Yeah. Got it.
Thanks, Stoddard.

All right, last hit Duffy
and López had on Salcedo,

he was deputy chief of
security for the cartel.

All right. So that much is true.

Had a degree in engineering.

Business license for a bio-diesel
factory that went belly-up.

- Wonder why.
- Ex-military.

Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

Who became head of
security for the cartel.

Must have been how he got the job.

Wonder if he clipped his old
buddy to take his spot.

And he was connected to the purchase
of b*mb in a plan to k*ll Pablo.

Oh, just that?

Does that sound like the
everyman who only signed on

- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

Scumbags I can handle. What
I don't like are liars.

So when he calls back
with Miguel's location...

- how you want to play it?
- If he calls at all,

we ask the hard questions,
see how he holds up.

[HENAO IN SPANISH] I'm
telling you, they're done.

Gilberto's looking for
some new way to surrender.

And you heard about this thing
in New York with Chepe, right?

And Miguel's in charge
of everything here.

Better said, the Cali cartel is d*ad.

[AMADO] And you intend to...?

To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

Which is why I'm talking to you.

[SNIFFING]

It's funny how things change, isn't it?

So, Amado... what do you say?

[SIGHS]

I say you're no f*cking
fun, that's what I say.

But we both see the future the same way.

Look, starting next week...

I'll only be shipping product for
my new North Valley friends. Good?

And what about the other
thing we discussed?

[SNIFFS]

[DAVID] Look, I need
you to make room here.

And I want you to take care of the
guests, get them everything they need.

I also want a bottle at
each of these tables.

But I want the good stuff. None
of that shit you serve here.

Understood?

I was told you needed me.

I need to talk about something.

Leave your bitch down here.

Come on.

[SIGHS]

You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

I was thinking about what you said...

if I ever need your advice, and...

I could use your help.

With your father's security.

He's coming to the party tonight.

He's coming here?

Unless there's another f*cking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

What do you want me to tell you, David?

Public places are always bad.

I know.

Too many people.

When does he plan on arriving?

I was thinking around 11:00.

Well, what f*cking time is best, then?

Well, I think ten is better.

It's less crowded. Maybe I can
take him up to the balcony.

You'll take care of it?

I knew I could count on you.

[SOFT CHUCKLE]

I just need this night to be perfect.

Everything has to go well.

You can relax. I think
we can manage that.

Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

Of course, you think he listened?

He's an imbecile.

Pull over here.

Pinchadito said there's a
bad phone tap or something.

[PULLS HAND BRAKE]

Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

[PHONE RINGING]

[SIGHS]

- [IN ENGLISH] Hello?
- It's Salcedo. I only have a minute.

- You got us both.
- Listen.

Miguel's going to a party tonight.

Libre Club. Carrera Ocho. Ten o'clock.

It's gonna be crowded, so you have to
wait to get him until he's outside.

Is there any way we can
check this, Jorge?

No. You're gonna have to trust me.

And this promotion to security chief?
How'd that come about?

That's... really complicated.

Okay, we're just trying to understand

why you would call us the
day after you get a raise.

We don't have time for this right now.

He's going to be in the club
at ten o'clock. Carrera Ocho.

Take him outside.

[IN SPANISH] Hey. What's going on?

Nothing, boss.

- He bothering you?
- [WOMAN] No, sir.

I'm just buying fritters for my brother.

Great, let's go.

- You want some?
- Sure.

[IN ENGLISH] ""Complicated."" Everything
with this guy is complicated.

Still, there's something
about him I believe.

Enough to walk into a
cartel party blind?

For a chance to get
Miguel Rodríguez, maybe.

He's just stringing us along, Chris.
Or worse.

She'll meet us in Miami.

[PANTING]

[SECRETARY] Ambassador, I've
got Agent Peña, line one.

- Peña?
- We got him.

I'd like to get him
into the United States

before the cartel knows he's in custody.

I spoke to the Prime Minister this
morning. Extradition papers are set.

As soon as he starts
talking, you let me know.

- I'll update Justice.
- Yeah, will do, sir.

Agent Peña. Good work.

I need to speak to you.

Okay. Girls...

please, go to your room

Something came up.

- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

I just want you to know that
I've almost got it figured out.

- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight,

but for now, I want you to get
everything ready to leave.

Where are we going? How...

Do you trust me?

My love...

Paola... do you trust me?

Yes?

Everything will be all right. I promise.

Done. I'm finished.

I love that length on you.

Thank you, I like it, too.

[SALSA MUSIC PLAYS AT A DISTANCE]

And... a little extra for you.

And I have a little extra for you, too.

- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

[SNIFFS, COUGHS]

[IN SPANISH] You were the
one who approached my wife?

You enjoy it?

Using her to get to me?

[IN ENGLISH] Know what I'd be thinking
about if I were you, Franklin?

That if your wife wants to see you...

she's gonna see you in jail.

Drive hours every week.

Get felt up by some sweaty guard
whose only highlight at work

is getting his hands
under your wife's dress.

[IN SPANISH] You can
say whatever you want.

- You can't scare me.
- No...

[IN SPANISH] I can just ruin your life.

You know the brothers.

Pretty well.

What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

You're young, Franklin. You have
your whole life ahead of you.

You really want to spend it in a cell?

Talk to me.

I'll get you a deal.
You and Christina...

can start over.

Have a new life.

In the United States.

I'm not going to say a single word...

until I see my wife.

Okay.

Then you'll have your witness.

We've called his room several times.
We're unable to locate him.

Okay, well, did he check out?

Can you tell me if he's...
Have you seen him at all?

Sounds like you don't know anything.

We have not seen him and
he has not checked out.

I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot help you.

Thank you for calling

No, no, thank you. Thank

Julia said you might have...
something on Crespo?

Well, yes.

It's something I hope you like.

How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

[CHUCKLES] Well...

I was hoping I could help you.

Where are you from?

- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

When you were young,

did you ever think you would come to
this country and do something special?

[CHUCKLES]

Well, I did.

I imagined myself coming here to
the United States, to New York...

and building something important.

That was also my dream.

The dream of a young
immigrant, like yourself.

And that's why I want to help you, to
make whatever dream you have a reality.

Whatever it is.

Regardless how much it costs.

In dollars.

You think you and I are the same

because we came to this
country with dreams?

Well...

My family fled Cuba because
we believed in freedom.

You came to sell cocaine.

Yes, we are both immigrants,

but we have nothing in common, Mr.
Santacruz.

My story is going to print.

Okay. Thank you for hearing my proposal.

Can I ask you a question?

How long will it take to get
to the airport from here?

I have no idea.

An hour or so.

[CHEPE LAUGHS]

I'll miss a lot about New York.

But not the traffic.

Looks like the whole family showed up.

Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

You know what?

I don't want this many people up here.

Good evening! Welcome to the Cali Fair!

Let's give a warm welcome to

You're giving me a tip.

You came through.

I also said to take him outside.
It's too risky in here.

Agent Peña. Alan Starkman.

Mr. Jurado's lawyer.

Yeah. Your client has

in exchange for testimony.

Before he learned that his
wife won't be joining him.

No. I've just spoken with his wife.

She's on her way to the
embassy in Bogotá.

Now, I was informed she never arrived.

Oh, go ahead. Check with your people.

It's my understanding that she met up
with Mr. Jurado's employers instead.

I guess she's had a change of heart.

Whatever deal you had
with my client... is off.

[DOOR OPENS]

Pacho is okay.

They're on their way back.

Are you okay?

- Close the damn door.

Darío, please take her upstairs.

I'm coming soon.

What happened there?

It looked like...

you knew something was coming.

Jorge! You know what? I know why.

Because you are always working.

You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

From now on, I want you back in
charge of my personal security.

Only you, Jorge.

Of course, Don Miguel.

And if you allow me, we don't know if
this will be the only attack or not.

So I need to know where
you are at all times.

Tomorrow is another day.

- [MIGUEL] Gilberto, it's me.
- Thank God!

- How are you, brother?
- We're okay.

Look, Gilberto, they tried
to k*ll Pacho, too.

- Pacho! No, it can't be...
- No, he's okay. He survived.

- He's on his way home.

These North Valley f*ck, I'm
going to k*ll them. Sons of bitches.

Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

Everybody's watching.

- It could ruin everything.
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to k*ll me.

They tried to k*ll my son.

They tried to k*ll María.
They tried to k*ll Pacho.

Yes, I understand, brother, but...

for now, we can't afford to start a w*r.

Especially being so
close to the surrender.

What f*cking surrender, Gilberto?

Before we can surrender, they'll
take everything from us.

- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no w*r. I understand.

You'll see.

Everything is going to be okay, brother.

Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

[IN ENGLISH] It's Salcedo.

- You alone?
- Yeah.

Get the f*ck in.

How the f*ck did you know where we were?

The same way I knew where to call you.
You think I'm gonna bring a g*n here?

- We don't know what to think.
- Why didn't you have a team there?

Because you never gave
us a straight answer.

- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- You're serious?

How's the North Valley sh**ting
up the place gonna help me?

You look like a hero, escorting
Miguel out the back.

I had to do my job.

You're still not telling
us the f*cking truth.

They k*ll the guy I replaced.

And they k*ll his wife.

And they're gonna do the same
thing to me and my family.

And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

Yeah.

Then we need to trust each other.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Tell me you know where Miguel is.

This is a SkyPager. All right?
It's untraceable. Even by you.

We'll be in touch.

[FEMALE REPORTER IN SPANISH]
Over 15 people were k*ll,

with dozens more injured

in a sh**t tonight
at a Cali nightclub.

Reports say the sh**ting
started after 10:00 p.m.

[DOOR OPENS]

- I was worried.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

- We're safe. We're safe.
- What happened?

It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

Where are we going?

Why do we have to leave?

What's going on?

Come with me. Come. Come. Come.

Tell me what's going on right now!

What I'm about to tell
you has to stay here.

You can't tell anyone, understand?

I'm working for the Americans.

It can't be.

It can't be.

I contacted the DEA.

I'm giving them Miguel.

In exchange, they will help
us get out of the country.

It's our only option.
There's no other way.

You're crazy.

They're going to k*ll all of us.

You're insane. What were you thinking?!

Paola...

[PEÑA]Things don't always
go according to plan.

You can use every hope and
prayer you have, take your sh*t,

and everything still goes to shit.

And when that happens, it's almost
like you never had a plan at all.

That's when people get desperate.

And things get dangerous.

[MIGUEL IN SPANISH] I want
to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

North Valley attacked us.

Their intentions were clear.

They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

Weak, with me in charge.

They are trying to destroy us.

Take what's ours.

I...

All of us know there's only one
appropriate response to this.

One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

what we've worked so hard to build.

w*r.

This is Gilberto's decision?

It's...

mine.

Hi, brother, it's me. How are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Better if I knew how this happened.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto, someone betrayed us.<br/>
<br/>
Where the f*ck were those pigs we pay?<br/>
<br/>
It was an American operation.<br/>
It was the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Our friends knew nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
Unless our friends<br/>
have been lying to us all along.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they need a reminder<br/>
what all that money was for.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
My situation will be rectified soon.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that things<br/>
are getting more complicated<br/>
<br/>
and our friends in the North Valley<br/>
need reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
You need to set a meeting with Henao.<br/>
<br/>
- Compliment him.<br/>
- [scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
- On what?<br/>
- Doesn't matter. Offer him something.<br/>
<br/>
He likes tequila. Have a bottle ready.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him... this is just a small setback.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime,<br/>
business goes on as usual.<br/>
<br/>
Increase your personal security.<br/>
<br/>
The Americans will come after you next.<br/>
<br/>
Your freedom is our best leverage,<br/>
brother.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
What if there's a leak?<br/>
<br/>
There may be.<br/>
<br/>
Find out.<br/>
<br/>
I need to go, brother. I love you.<br/>
<br/>
I love you too, brother.<br/>
<br/>
[phone ringing]<br/>
<br/>
- [Peña in English] What do you got for me?<br/>
- Dog shit. Minus the dog and the shit.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we knew it wasn't gonna be easy.<br/>
You gotta get creative.<br/>
<br/>
All due respect, we're being told that<br/>
we can't leave the base without an escort,<br/>
<br/>
and now,<br/>
in a truly shocking turn of events,<br/>
<br/>
we're being told there isn't<br/>
enough manpower to assign us one.<br/>
<br/>
We're f*cking grounded.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'll see what I can do<br/>
with the lockdown. I gotta go.<br/>
<br/>
I'm meeting with the new<br/>
Minister of Defense.<br/>
<br/>
And Feistl...<br/>
<br/>
you asked for this.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget that, 'cause I know I won't.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña] Colombia had recently elected<br/>
a new president,<br/>
<br/>
a man named Ernesto Samper.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar's hitters had tried<br/>
to assassinate him in an earlier election.<br/>
<br/>
So he was no friend of the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
And while he knew his country<br/>
was tired of v*olence,<br/>
<br/>
he and his new staff, including<br/>
Defense Minister Fernando Botero,<br/>
<br/>
were already in a tough spot.<br/>
<br/>
Politically, the surrender deal was ugly.<br/>
<br/>
But they were willing to live with it.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto's arrest made that<br/>
harder than planned,<br/>
<br/>
and they weren't shy about saying it.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to offer my congratulations<br/>
<br/>
on the arrest of Gilberto Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Martínez deserves the credit.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately,<br/>
he isn't here to receive it.<br/>
<br/>
He should be.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine he knew there might be<br/>
consequences for his actions.<br/>
<br/>
A surrender deal was on the table,<br/>
<br/>
which would've brought all four leaders<br/>
of the Cali cartel to justice.<br/>
<br/>
And now, that's been complicated,<br/>
<br/>
and we are faced with the unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Understood.<br/>
<br/>
Though I'm not sure m*rder negotiating<br/>
their own punishment qualifies as justice.<br/>
<br/>
The deal preceded my tenure.<br/>
<br/>
But between the two of us,<br/>
I share your reservations.<br/>
<br/>
But no one wants a return<br/>
to the days of Pablo Escobar<br/>
<br/>
and the bloodshed of Los Pepes.<br/>
<br/>
No, of course not.<br/>
<br/>
I won't ask if the rumors<br/>
<br/>
about your involvement<br/>
with the vigilantes are true,<br/>
<br/>
but I do have a question.<br/>
<br/>
If it turns out that we are indeed<br/>
on the same side...<br/>
<br/>
can I trust you?<br/>
<br/>
You can trust that my only agenda<br/>
is to take down the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can do anything.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, my team in Cali<br/>
are operating under...<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
severe restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
They need their independence.<br/>
<br/>
I'll make a call.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Peña.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Justice can be hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
And a man as powerful<br/>
as Gilberto Rodríguez<br/>
<br/>
won't stay in custody for long.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to keep him behind bars,<br/>
you need someone to testify.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Yes, sir. I'm on it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a high-level target.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you work fast,<br/>
because without it,<br/>
<br/>
nothing else will matter.<br/>
<br/>
[Córdova]<br/>
We went through the machine, sir.<br/>
<br/>
We've got nothing.<br/>
<br/>
So what am I supposed to do with that?<br/>
What does this mean?<br/>
<br/>
If somebody sold us out,<br/>
we'd know about it.<br/>
<br/>
Like you knew about the raid?<br/>
<br/>
Look, gentlemen...<br/>
<br/>
I want to know why my brother<br/>
is sitting in a f*cking cell.<br/>
<br/>
And if any one of us is involved in this,<br/>
I want to know by the end of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Of course. Consider it done, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel's paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they used one of their spy planes<br/>
and spotted Gilberto from space.<br/>
<br/>
You're not taking this seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.<br/>
He thinks there's a leak.<br/>
<br/>
And the system would tell us<br/>
about the leak.<br/>
<br/>
This is about the surrender, right?<br/>
<br/>
You're worried your retirement plans<br/>
are ruined now.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
People love drama, brother. You know that.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't drama. He wants names.<br/>
<br/>
And there's no reason to think<br/>
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.<br/>
<br/>
We designed the system.<br/>
<br/>
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Córdova.<br/>
<br/>
[Córdova] So? Anything good?<br/>
<br/>
Just a bunch of shit-talking.<br/>
Gossip. Typical.<br/>
<br/>
And what about internally?<br/>
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?<br/>
<br/>
[Pinchadito] No, not really.<br/>
<br/>
Truth is, I have no idea<br/>
who would rat these guys out.<br/>
<br/>
I want to hear everything you've flagged<br/>
all the same. Quickly.<br/>
<br/>
[Pinchadito]<br/>
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.<br/>
<br/>
[man] These guys were supposed<br/>
to have this under control.<br/>
<br/>
But it's clear they don't.<br/>
<br/>
[woman] I thought those guys<br/>
were supposed to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean it's not happening?<br/>
<br/>
[man 2] Somebody tipped off the Americans,<br/>
s*ab us in the back.<br/>
<br/>
[man 3] Where was his f*cking<br/>
security team? What do they pay them for?<br/>
<br/>
[man 4] They better do something quick,<br/>
<br/>
or else it's going to be<br/>
every man for himself.<br/>
<br/>
[lawyer] You have many powerful allies,<br/>
Don Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Your situation pains them deeply.<br/>
<br/>
We're confident this will soon be<br/>
behind us. The surrender will proceed.<br/>
<br/>
But we need to wait.<br/>
It's a matter of time.<br/>
<br/>
Wait for what?<br/>
<br/>
For the government to do something<br/>
they already agreed to? f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
What did Medina say?<br/>
<br/>
Currently, we don't have<br/>
an official position from Santiago Medina.<br/>
<br/>
Why not?<br/>
<br/>
[clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
Because we're waiting on his office<br/>
to confirm a meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Are you f*cking kidding me?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't talk to him yet?<br/>
<br/>
You're waiting on his office<br/>
to confirm a meeting?<br/>
<br/>
I don't wait on him!<br/>
<br/>
He waits on me!<br/>
<br/>
You go to his office and fix this mess!<br/>
<br/>
And remind him who the f*ck<br/>
Gilberto Rodríguez is!<br/>
<br/>
For f*ck's sake! Open this damn thing!<br/>
<br/>
Nicolás, your father needs to understand<br/>
his arrest changes things.<br/>
<br/>
It's political now.<br/>
<br/>
Dad?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you have to put on<br/>
a little show.<br/>
<br/>
Helps bring the best out of people.<br/>
<br/>
I need to talk to Medina.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want you anywhere near this.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, the circle is too big.<br/>
<br/>
Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.<br/>
He won't trust the lawyers.<br/>
<br/>
But he will trust you?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm your son.<br/>
<br/>
That's right. And you'll obey my wishes.<br/>
<br/>
[gate closes]<br/>
<br/>
[Christina in English]<br/>
It's cold here all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I wake up and the bed is freezing, empty.<br/>
<br/>
[Franklin]<br/>
I know, bonita. I'll be home soon.<br/>
<br/>
[Christina]<br/>
I just wish I could be there with you.<br/>
<br/>
[Franklin] I told you, Chris, it wouldn't<br/>
look right. It's not a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Any word on the location?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing yet.<br/>
<br/>
[Christina] I don't know, Franklin.<br/>
Maybe now is the perfect f*cking time.<br/>
<br/>
You really think they're gonna stop<br/>
with Gilberto?<br/>
<br/>
And how long before the DEA<br/>
comes looking for you? For us?<br/>
<br/>
[Franklin] Listen, I need you<br/>
to be strong, okay, babe?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody knows about us.<br/>
Nobody's looking for me, I promise.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call later. I love you.<br/>
<br/>
- No, wait, Franklin...<br/>
- [tape stops]<br/>
<br/>
She's panicking.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
To give things a push.<br/>
We're running out of time.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, can we talk<br/>
about this wire tap, though?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the legality of it?<br/>
<br/>
Stoddard...<br/>
<br/>
I want you to think about<br/>
where you see your career in five years.<br/>
<br/>
Does having that conversation help<br/>
or hurt your chances of getting there?<br/>
<br/>
[clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
[clock chiming]<br/>
<br/>
[Miguel in Spanish]<br/>
You want something to drink?<br/>
<br/>
I never refuse.<br/>
<br/>
That's a great shirt, no?<br/>
<br/>
That pocket...<br/>
<br/>
on the left.<br/>
<br/>
Where the heart is.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, this situation with Gilberto,<br/>
<br/>
what a disgrace, huh?<br/>
<br/>
After all your family's done<br/>
for this city. For this country.<br/>
<br/>
Just the gringos meddling<br/>
where they shouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
But our friends in Bogotá<br/>
are working to...<br/>
<br/>
rectify the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Business proceeds as usual, right?<br/>
<br/>
And how does this clerical error<br/>
affect the timeline of the surrender?<br/>
<br/>
As I said...<br/>
<br/>
this was just a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
- [door closes]<br/>
- [footsteps approaching]<br/>
<br/>
I see a lot of new faces.<br/>
<br/>
[salsa music playing]<br/>
<br/>
Did you notice that?<br/>
<br/>
The woman, the Salazar girl?<br/>
<br/>
The fear.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel was scared.<br/>
<br/>
These guys are in big trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Little early for number three, no?<br/>
<br/>
The f*ck else am I supposed to do<br/>
around here?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't have to come.<br/>
<br/>
Who else was gonna watch your back?<br/>
<br/>
[scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
You gonna tell me<br/>
what went down in Juárez?<br/>
<br/>
I told you...<br/>
<br/>
we talked.<br/>
<br/>
The Mexican made you an offer.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't he?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty good one, too.<br/>
<br/>
He says we're getting out<br/>
at the wrong time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he's right.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto's in jail.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is fate.<br/>
<br/>
[in English]<br/>
How'd you come up with this place?<br/>
<br/>
Buddy in the Defense Department.<br/>
<br/>
The place was leased out<br/>
to debrief a witness against Noriega.<br/>
<br/>
That was like three years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Danny, you never cease to amaze me.<br/>
<br/>
Not bad, right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, the f*cking A/C's still running.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, your tax dollars at work.<br/>
<br/>
So? What's our first move?<br/>
<br/>
Circle back. See if we can pick up a trail<br/>
on that accountant.<br/>
<br/>
World's deadliest fanny pack,<br/>
back in action.<br/>
<br/>
Better f*cking believe it.<br/>
<br/>
- [cumbia music playing]<br/>
- [indistinct chatter]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] No, the bill, please.<br/>
<br/>
[man] Compliments of the gentleman.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you, but I don't...<br/>
- Oh, uh...<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Did I come over too fast?<br/>
<br/>
It's tricky business<br/>
starting a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Not a lot of margin for error.<br/>
<br/>
You're an American.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Javi. From Texas.<br/>
<br/>
- You?<br/>
- I'm from Boston originally.<br/>
<br/>
Strangers in a strange land.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope you don't mind. I was...<br/>
<br/>
I saw you sitting over here and you...<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
reminded me of someone, someone from home.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Sentimental.<br/>
<br/>
Just a lonely patriot.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought we could talk.<br/>
<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
- No, I mean it. Just...<br/>
<br/>
Just talk.<br/>
<br/>
- I heard people still do that sometimes.<br/>
- Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You know,<br/>
I think I saw it in a movie once.<br/>
<br/>
Look, you seem like a nice guy,<br/>
<br/>
but I get the feeling<br/>
that just talking isn't your forte.<br/>
<br/>
- And... I'm married, so...<br/>
- Happily?<br/>
<br/>
[scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Look at you now.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles] What? I mean, come on.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband lets you brave the dangers<br/>
of happy hour by yourself?<br/>
<br/>
He's traveling for work.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, can I guess? He's...<br/>
<br/>
an astronaut.<br/>
<br/>
- Brain surgeon.<br/>
- Yeah, uh-huh, a little bit of both.<br/>
<br/>
- Uh-huh.<br/>
- Banking.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I couldn't like him any less.<br/>
<br/>
- I mean... [laughs]<br/>
- [gasps]<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, this has been fun.<br/>
<br/>
So, what exotic destination<br/>
could pull him away from...<br/>
<br/>
from all this?<br/>
<br/>
[exhales]<br/>
<br/>
Say hi to Texas for me.<br/>
<br/>
Christina.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't tell you my name.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't have to.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
You got me. How do you know my name?<br/>
<br/>
Same way I know that your husband...<br/>
isn't in banking.<br/>
<br/>
My name's Javier Peña. I work for the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
You want to sit back down,<br/>
have a conversation?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not interested.<br/>
Enjoy your drink, Eliot Ness.<br/>
<br/>
[whispers] f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] The bill.<br/>
<br/>
[tapping bar counter]<br/>
<br/>
And they don't appear<br/>
on the next flights either?<br/>
<br/>
- [man] No.<br/>
- [exhales]<br/>
<br/>
Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck gringos<br/>
never got on a plane back to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
- Our friend with the badge lied to us.<br/>
- Or he made a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
There are no mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
[gate creaks]<br/>
<br/>
[gate bangs]<br/>
<br/>
Hey. Here he comes.<br/>
<br/>
[Córdova] There he is,<br/>
the f*cking bastard.<br/>
<br/>
I would have gladly met you<br/>
in the usual place.<br/>
<br/>
That's what you're worried about?<br/>
<br/>
How about earning the money we pay you<br/>
to keep our bosses out of jail?<br/>
<br/>
- You couldn't give a f*ck about that.<br/>
- The f*ck you want from me?<br/>
<br/>
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.<br/>
All that shit came out of Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
By the time we knew what they were...<br/>
<br/>
Martínez had already been<br/>
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,<br/>
<br/>
you useless piece of shit.<br/>
<br/>
You know what else is odd?<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the DEA never left Cali.<br/>
<br/>
And you were the one who confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
You. Only you confirmed those two f*cking<br/>
gringos took the plane to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where you are?<br/>
<br/>
You want to hang me out to dry<br/>
with your boss? Do you know where you are?<br/>
<br/>
I asked the Americans how they found<br/>
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?<br/>
<br/>
They followed someone there.<br/>
<br/>
I know it wasn't me.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking Calderón.<br/>
<br/>
What he said made sense.<br/>
<br/>
The DEA followed someone<br/>
to Gilberto's house.<br/>
<br/>
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows<br/>
who he is and where he works.<br/>
<br/>
They must have come back<br/>
and tailed him to Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari<br/>
to Gilberto's that night?<br/>
<br/>
It could just as easily have been me<br/>
driving him.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?<br/>
<br/>
You think Miguel will let this slide?<br/>
<br/>
Not a f*cking chance.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,<br/>
it comes back on you,<br/>
<br/>
and then we're both f*cked.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we need is a name,<br/>
and we have it.<br/>
<br/>
We have to get on the same page here.<br/>
<br/>
Calderón told us those f*ck from<br/>
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?<br/>
<br/>
He b*rned us.<br/>
<br/>
He is the one responsible<br/>
for what happened.<br/>
<br/>
He's a dirty cop...<br/>
<br/>
who takes money from a drug cartel.<br/>
<br/>
But you and me, we are brothers.<br/>
<br/>
Let me cut to the chase.<br/>
My father still wants to retire.<br/>
<br/>
[grunts]<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realize you were taking such<br/>
an active role in your father's affairs.<br/>
<br/>
No other choice when friends<br/>
don't return our lawyer's calls.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then...<br/>
<br/>
tell your father there is still a path<br/>
to what he wants most.<br/>
<br/>
No one here is happy<br/>
with the current predicament.<br/>
<br/>
The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's<br/>
been difficult to carry out our old deal.<br/>
<br/>
""Old deal""?<br/>
<br/>
Nicolás...<br/>
<br/>
Politics is about appearances.<br/>
<br/>
For us, it's extremely difficult<br/>
to accept the surrender terms of a man<br/>
<br/>
who's already in prison.<br/>
<br/>
That just looks bad.<br/>
<br/>
But different terms...<br/>
<br/>
new terms...<br/>
<br/>
What do you say?<br/>
<br/>
So what did you find out?<br/>
<br/>
The DEA team Calderón was escorting<br/>
never left Cali.<br/>
<br/>
He reported that they had.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
It was a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Born of incompetence.<br/>
<br/>
The DEA got lucky...<br/>
<br/>
and Calderón took the bait.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, that doesn't explain<br/>
how they found my brother.<br/>
<br/>
How did they get that information?<br/>
Was that also Calderón?<br/>
<br/>
It's unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible the DEA used<br/>
some high-end aerial surveillance.<br/>
<br/>
From here on out, keep an eye on Calderón.<br/>
<br/>
Limit what we tell him.<br/>
<br/>
No more lapses in security.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
[cumbia music playing]<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
It's either him or us.<br/>
<br/>
What if they k*ll him?<br/>
<br/>
They wouldn't k*ll a cop.<br/>
<br/>
But they can question him.<br/>
And then what? What?<br/>
<br/>
By the time they get to it,<br/>
this shit will all be over.<br/>
<br/>
[sniffs]<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[phone ringing]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Hello?<br/>
<br/>
[man] Good afternoon. Someone is here<br/>
for you, Mrs. Jurado. Mr. Eliot Ness.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Thanks for seeing me.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't want you waving a badge<br/>
around our lobby.<br/>
<br/>
Are you gonna arrest me?<br/>
<br/>
You want to sit?<br/>
<br/>
If what I wanted counted for anything,<br/>
<br/>
you wouldn't be in my living room now.<br/>
<br/>
May not see it this way yet, but I...<br/>
I am here to help you.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm sure my well-being<br/>
is your top priority.<br/>
<br/>
It's why you were<br/>
buying me martinis at the bar.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto Rodríguez is in jail.<br/>
<br/>
It won't be long before he has company.<br/>
<br/>
There's a very small window<br/>
for people like you and your husband<br/>
<br/>
to still be of any use to us.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
You're running out of time.<br/>
<br/>
So if Franklin really does care about you,<br/>
then he'll do what's right.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I don't know if the two of you<br/>
are thinking about starting a family...<br/>
<br/>
Okay, look, for the record, you don't know<br/>
a f*cking thing about my husband or me.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. You're right.<br/>
<br/>
But I do know<br/>
that there is no future for you...<br/>
<br/>
in any version of how this plays out<br/>
if he doesn't help us.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't plan on living like this.<br/>
It was...<br/>
<br/>
It was a mistake...<br/>
<br/>
not stopping it sooner.<br/>
<br/>
You ever done anything like that?<br/>
<br/>
I have.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
what, that's it?<br/>
<br/>
That's it.<br/>
<br/>
Think it over. But don't take too long.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
Don't you even want to know what he said?<br/>
<br/>
How dare you disregard my wishes.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was going to get in a room<br/>
with Medina, I did...<br/>
<br/>
I don't want you involved.<br/>
I won't even discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
The old deal is d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
But we can make a new one,<br/>
with certain adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Adjustments how?<br/>
<br/>
There has to be some jail time.<br/>
<br/>
For you, Uncle Miguel, Pacho, and Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
Three years.<br/>
<br/>
Three years? No chance.<br/>
<br/>
You surrender your illegal assets,<br/>
do the three years,<br/>
<br/>
and the legitimate assets, the cash,<br/>
the business, will all be retained.<br/>
<br/>
That's not the deal.<br/>
And you won't speak of this again.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, stop being so stubborn!<br/>
<br/>
You don't get to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
You are in jail.<br/>
<br/>
You are a narcotrafficker.<br/>
<br/>
No politician is going to stand up<br/>
and say, ""Let him go,""<br/>
<br/>
no matter how much money<br/>
you've put in his pocket.<br/>
<br/>
But son, it's three years...<br/>
<br/>
It's not the old deal,<br/>
but it's a good one.<br/>
<br/>
The best we're going to get.<br/>
<br/>
But there's one loose end.<br/>
<br/>
Medina is worried about his exposure.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically, the accountant...<br/>
Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
He knows too much.<br/>
<br/>

[Franklin] Hola, bonita.<br/>
<br/>

Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.<br/>

Can you leave it there?<br/>

Franklin... what are we gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
Christina, you can't just walk away<br/>
from these people.<br/>
<br/>
I know you keep saying that,<br/>
<br/>
but maybe... maybe we have<br/>
more options than we think.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, ""more options""?<br/>
<br/>
[Christina] You know things.<br/>
You know things about the organization.<br/>
<br/>
- How things...<br/>
- [Franklin] Want me to be a rat?<br/>
<br/>
You been talking to someone?<br/>
I told you...<br/>
<br/>
[Christina] No, Franklin, we need to talk.<br/>
We really need to talk about the future.<br/>
<br/>
[Franklin] We can't do this<br/>
on the phone, okay? I'll call later.<br/>
<br/>
Rewind.<br/>

Okay.<br/>

She's all quiet, looking at me like this.<br/>
<br/>
Not a word.<br/>

I'm like, ""What the f*ck?""<br/>
I turn to see Toque.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck, he has a g*n pointed at him.<br/>

And the other girl,<br/>

<br/>
""Give me the money,<br/>
or she bites your dick off.""<br/>
<br/>

I want to give them an answer.<br/>
Some good news.<br/>

<br/>
About the time my father<br/>
found me in my room with a boy.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My father told me I wasn't a man,<br/>
that I'd never be one.<br/>
<br/>
It was the last time he spoke to me.<br/>
<br/>
What a f*cking bastard.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time, I thought he was right.<br/>
<br/>
Even after I started working<br/>
for Gilberto and Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
Up until the day some f*ck<br/>
told them I was a f*g.<br/>
<br/>
And that it was a mistake<br/>
to let me be part of the business.<br/>
<br/>
You know what they did?<br/>
<br/>
They made me a partner.<br/>

Gilberto, Miguel, and Chepe,<br/>
they are my family.<br/>
<br/>
I can't just leave them<br/>
when they need me the most.<br/>
<br/>

[buzzer sounds]

[men groaning]

[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

[exhales]

[sighs]

[Vargas in English]
According to our intelligence,

Gilberto Rodríguez was
a s*ab influence on the cartel.

His arrest may lead
to an increased v*olence

against civilians and police.

No doubt...

the cartel leaders...

are now in hiding,

and their security apparatus
is operating in a state of high alert.

So... the only thing we can be certain of

is that any further operation
against the cartel

will be both very difficult
and extremely dangerous.

We appreciate the volatility
of the situation, General.

Well, in that case,
I will turn things over to the man

who's responsible for this situation.

Maybe he can walk us through
his path to victory.

So Agent Peña, what comes next?

The floor is yours.

[theme music playing]

[buzzing]

[clicks]

[gate opens]

[guard] Don Gilberto.

[in Spanish] Leave it there.

[guard] Okay.

Enjoy your meal.

[line ringing]

Hello?

[Gilberto]
Hi, brother, it's me. How are you doing?

Better if I knew how this happened.

Gilberto, someone betrayed us.

Where the f*ck were those pigs we pay?

It was an American operation.
It was the DEA.

Our friends knew nothing about it.

Unless our friends
have been lying to us all along.

Maybe they need a reminder
what all that money was for.

Relax, Miguel.

My situation will be rectified soon.

The truth is that things
are getting more complicated

and our friends in the North Valley
need reassurance.

You need to set a meeting with Henao.

- Compliment him.
- [scoffs]

- On what?
- Doesn't matter. Offer him something.

He likes tequila. Have a bottle ready.

Tell him... this is just a small setback.

In the meantime,
business goes on as usual.

Increase your personal security.

The Americans will come after you next.

Your freedom is our best leverage,
brother.

Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.

What if there's a leak?

There may be.

Find out.

I need to go, brother. I love you.

I love you too, brother.

[phone ringing]

- [Peña in English] What do you got for me?
- Dog shit. Minus the dog and the shit.

Well, we knew it wasn't gonna be easy.
You gotta get creative.

All due respect, we're being told that
we can't leave the base without an escort,

and now,
in a truly shocking turn of events,

we're being told there isn't
enough manpower to assign us one.

We're f*cking grounded.

Look, I'll see what I can do
with the lockdown. I gotta go.

I'm meeting with the new
Minister of Defense.

And Feistl...

you asked for this.

Don't forget that, 'cause I know I won't.

[Peña] Colombia had recently elected
a new president,

a man named Ernesto Samper.

Escobar's hitters had tried
to assassinate him in an earlier election.

So he was no friend of the narcos.

And while he knew his country
was tired of v*olence,

he and his new staff, including
Defense Minister Fernando Botero,

were already in a tough spot.

Politically, the surrender deal was ugly.

But they were willing to live with it.

Gilberto's arrest made that
harder than planned,

and they weren't shy about saying it.

I wanted to offer my congratulations

on the arrest of Gilberto Rodríguez.

Thank you, sir.

Colonel Martínez deserves the credit.

Unfortunately,
he isn't here to receive it.

He should be.

I imagine he knew there might be
consequences for his actions.

A surrender deal was on the table,

which would've brought all four leaders
of the Cali cartel to justice.

And now, that's been complicated,

and we are faced with the unknown.

Understood.

Though I'm not sure m*rder negotiating
their own punishment qualifies as justice.

The deal preceded my tenure.

But between the two of us,
I share your reservations.

But no one wants a return
to the days of Pablo Escobar

and the bloodshed of Los Pepes.

No, of course not.

I won't ask if the rumors

about your involvement
with the vigilantes are true,

but I do have a question.

If it turns out that we are indeed
on the same side...

can I trust you?

You can trust that my only agenda
is to take down the Cali cartel.

Let me know if I can do anything.

Sir, my team in Cali
are operating under...

[sighs]

severe restrictions.

They need their independence.

I'll make a call.

Thank you, sir.

Peña.

[in Spanish] Justice can be hard to find.

And a man as powerful
as Gilberto Rodríguez

won't stay in custody for long.

If you want to keep him behind bars,
you need someone to testify.

[in Spanish] Yes, sir. I'm on it.

I'm working on a high-level target.

I suggest you work fast,
because without it,

nothing else will matter.

[Córdova]
We went through the machine, sir.

We've got nothing.

So what am I supposed to do with that?
What does this mean?

If somebody sold us out,
we'd know about it.

Like you knew about the raid?

Look, gentlemen...

I want to know why my brother
is sitting in a f*cking cell.

And if any one of us is involved in this,
I want to know by the end of the day.

Of course. Consider it done, sir.

Miguel's paranoid.

Maybe they used one of their spy planes
and spotted Gilberto from space.

You're not taking this seriously.

Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.
He thinks there's a leak.

And the system would tell us
about the leak.

This is about the surrender, right?

You're worried your retirement plans
are ruined now.

Listen to me.

People love drama, brother. You know that.

This isn't drama. He wants names.

And there's no reason to think
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.

We designed the system.

[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

Mr. Córdova.

[Córdova] So? Anything good?

Just a bunch of shit-talking.
Gossip. Typical.

And what about internally?
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?

[Pinchadito] No, not really.

Truth is, I have no idea
who would rat these guys out.

I want to hear everything you've flagged
all the same. Quickly.

[Pinchadito]
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.

[man] These guys were supposed
to have this under control.

But it's clear they don't.

[woman] I thought those guys
were supposed to surrender.

Does this mean it's not happening?

[man 2] Somebody tipped off the Americans,
s*ab us in the back.

[man 3] Where was his f*cking
security team? What do they pay them for?

[man 4] They better do something quick,

or else it's going to be
every man for himself.

[lawyer] You have many powerful allies,
Don Gilberto.

Your situation pains them deeply.

We're confident this will soon be
behind us. The surrender will proceed.

But we need to wait.
It's a matter of time.

Wait for what?

For the government to do something
they already agreed to? f*ck.

What did Medina say?

Currently, we don't have
an official position from Santiago Medina.

Why not?

[clears throat]

Because we're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

You didn't talk to him yet?

You're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting?

I don't wait on him!

He waits on me!

You go to his office and fix this mess!

And remind him who the f*ck
Gilberto Rodríguez is!

For f*ck's sake! Open this damn thing!

Nicolás, your father needs to understand
his arrest changes things.

It's political now.

Dad?

Sometimes you have to put on
a little show.

Helps bring the best out of people.

I need to talk to Medina.

I don't want you anywhere near this.

Dad, the circle is too big.

Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.
He won't trust the lawyers.

But he will trust you?

Yes, I'm your son.

That's right. And you'll obey my wishes.

[gate closes]

[Christina in English]
It's cold here all the time.

I wake up and the bed is freezing, empty.

[Franklin]
I know, bonita. I'll be home soon.

[Christina]
I just wish I could be there with you.

[Franklin] I told you, Chris, it wouldn't
look right. It's not a good time.

Any word on the location?

Nothing yet.

[Christina] I don't know, Franklin.
Maybe now is the perfect f*cking time.

You really think they're gonna stop
with Gilberto?

And how long before the DEA
comes looking for you? For us?

[Franklin] Listen, I need you
to be strong, okay, babe?

Nobody knows about us.
Nobody's looking for me, I promise.

I'll call later. I love you.

- No, wait, Franklin...
- [tape stops]

She's panicking.

Where are you going?

To give things a push.
We're running out of time.

Okay, can we talk
about this wire tap, though?

I mean, the legality of it?

Stoddard...

I want you to think about
where you see your career in five years.

Does having that conversation help
or hurt your chances of getting there?

[clears throat]

[clock chiming]

[Miguel in Spanish]
You want something to drink?

I never refuse.

That's a great shirt, no?

That pocket...

on the left.

Where the heart is.

Hey, this situation with Gilberto,

what a disgrace, huh?

After all your family's done
for this city. For this country.

Just the gringos meddling
where they shouldn't.

But our friends in Bogotá
are working to...

rectify the situation.

Business proceeds as usual, right?

And how does this clerical error
affect the timeline of the surrender?

As I said...

this was just a mistake.

Nothing more.

Glad to hear that.

- [door closes]
- [footsteps approaching]

I see a lot of new faces.

[salsa music playing]

Did you notice that?

The woman, the Salazar girl?

The fear.

Miguel was scared.

These guys are in big trouble.

Little early for number three, no?

The f*ck else am I supposed to do
around here?

You didn't have to come.

Who else was gonna watch your back?

[scoffs]

You gonna tell me
what went down in Juárez?

I told you...

we talked.

The Mexican made you an offer.

Didn't he?

Yes.

Pretty good one, too.

He says we're getting out
at the wrong time.

Maybe he's right.

Gilberto's in jail.

Maybe this is fate.

[in English]
How'd you come up with this place?

Buddy in the Defense Department.

The place was leased out
to debrief a witness against Noriega.

That was like three years ago.

Danny, you never cease to amaze me.

Not bad, right?

Well, the f*cking A/C's still running.

Yeah, your tax dollars at work.

So? What's our first move?

Circle back. See if we can pick up a trail
on that accountant.

World's deadliest fanny pack,
back in action.

Better f*cking believe it.

- [cumbia music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

[in Spanish] No, the bill, please.

[man] Compliments of the gentleman.

- Thank you, but I don't...
- Oh, uh...

[in English] Did I come over too fast?

It's tricky business
starting a conversation.

Not a lot of margin for error.

You're an American.

Yeah. Javi. From Texas.

- You?
- I'm from Boston originally.

Strangers in a strange land.

Well, I hope you don't mind. I was...

I saw you sitting over here and you...

[chuckles]

reminded me of someone, someone from home.

Ah! Sentimental.

Just a lonely patriot.

Anyway, I thought we could talk.

- Okay.
- No, I mean it. Just...

Just talk.

- I heard people still do that sometimes.
- Oh, yeah.

You know,
I think I saw it in a movie once.

Look, you seem like a nice guy,

but I get the feeling
that just talking isn't your forte.

- And... I'm married, so...
- Happily?

[scoffs]

Wow. Look at you now.

[chuckles] What? I mean, come on.

Your husband lets you brave the dangers
of happy hour by yourself?

He's traveling for work.

Oh, can I guess? He's...

an astronaut.

- Brain surgeon.
- Yeah, uh-huh, a little bit of both.

- Uh-huh.
- Banking.

Oh, f*ck.

I thought I couldn't like him any less.

- I mean... [laughs]
- [gasps]

Okay, well, this has been fun.

So, what exotic destination
could pull him away from...

from all this?

[exhales]

Say hi to Texas for me.

Christina.

I didn't tell you my name.

You didn't have to.

Okay.

You got me. How do you know my name?

Same way I know that your husband...
isn't in banking.

My name's Javier Peña. I work for the DEA.

You want to sit back down,
have a conversation?

I'm not interested.
Enjoy your drink, Eliot Ness.

[whispers] f*ck.

[in Spanish] The bill.

[tapping bar counter]

And they don't appear
on the next flights either?

- [man] No.
- [exhales]

Jorge.

f*ck gringos
never got on a plane back to Bogotá.

- Our friend with the badge lied to us.
- Or he made a mistake.

There are no mistakes.

[gate creaks]

[gate bangs]

Hey. Here he comes.

[Córdova] There he is,
the f*cking bastard.

I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

That's what you're worried about?

How about earning the money we pay you
to keep our bosses out of jail?

- You couldn't give a f*ck about that.
- The f*ck you want from me?

Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotá.

By the time we knew what they were...

Martínez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

you useless piece of shit.

You know what else is odd?

It looks like the DEA never left Cali.

And you were the one who confirmed.

You. Only you confirmed those two f*cking
gringos took the plane to Bogotá.

Do you know where you are?

You want to hang me out to dry
with your boss? Do you know where you are?

I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

They followed someone there.

I know it wasn't me.

f*cking Calderón.

What he said made sense.

The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

They must have come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

It could just as easily have been me
driving him.

Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

You think Miguel will let this slide?

Not a f*cking chance.

Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

and then we're both f*cked.

The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

We have to get on the same page here.

Calderón told us those f*ck from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?

He b*rned us.

He is the one responsible
for what happened.

He's a dirty cop...

who takes money from a drug cartel.

But you and me, we are brothers.

Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

[grunts]

I didn't realize you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

Of course.

Well, then...

tell your father there is still a path
to what he wants most.

No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's
been difficult to carry out our old deal.

""Old deal""?

Nicolás...

Politics is about appearances.

For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms of a man

who's already in prison.

That just looks bad.

But different terms...

new terms...

What do you say?

So what did you find out?

The DEA team Calderón was escorting
never left Cali.

He reported that they had.

What do you think, Jorge?

It was a mistake.

Born of incompetence.

The DEA got lucky...

and Calderón took the bait.

Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderón?

It's unlikely.

It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

From here on out, keep an eye on Calderón.

Limit what we tell him.

No more lapses in security.

Yes, sir.

Let's go.

[cumbia music playing]

Thank you, Jorge.

It's either him or us.

What if they k*ll him?

They wouldn't k*ll a cop.

But they can question him.
And then what? What?

By the time they get to it,
this shit will all be over.

[sniffs]

[sighs]

[phone ringing]

[in Spanish] Hello?

[man] Good afternoon. Someone is here
for you, Mrs. Jurado. Mr. Eliot Ness.

[in English] Thanks for seeing me.

Didn't want you waving a badge
around our lobby.

Are you gonna arrest me?

You want to sit?

If what I wanted counted for anything,

you wouldn't be in my living room now.

May not see it this way yet, but I...
I am here to help you.

[chuckles]

Oh, I'm sure my well-being
is your top priority.

It's why you were
buying me martinis at the bar.

Gilberto Rodríguez is in jail.

It won't be long before he has company.

There's a very small window
for people like you and your husband

to still be of any use to us.

Hmm.

You're running out of time.

So if Franklin really does care about you,
then he'll do what's right.

I mean, I don't know if the two of you
are thinking about starting a family...

Okay, look, for the record, you don't know
a f*cking thing about my husband or me.

Okay. You're right.

But I do know
that there is no future for you...

in any version of how this plays out
if he doesn't help us.

I didn't plan on living like this.
It was...

It was a mistake...

not stopping it sooner.

You ever done anything like that?

I have.

Okay.

So...

what, that's it?

That's it.

Think it over. But don't take too long.

[in Spanish]
Don't you even want to know what he said?

How dare you disregard my wishes.

Nobody was going to get in a room
with Medina, I did...

I don't want you involved.
I won't even discuss it.

The old deal is d*ad.

But we can make a new one,
with certain adjustments.

f*ck.

Adjustments how?

There has to be some jail time.

For you, Uncle Miguel, Pacho, and Chepe.

Three years.

Three years? No chance.

You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

Dad, stop being so stubborn!

You don't get to surrender.

You are in jail.

You are a narcotrafficker.

No politician is going to stand up
and say, ""Let him go,""

no matter how much money
you've put in his pocket.

But son, it's three years...

It's not the old deal,
but it's a good one.

The best we're going to get.

But there's one loose end.

Medina is worried about his exposure.

More specifically, the accountant...
Pallomari.

He knows too much.

[phone ringing]

[Franklin] Hola, bonita.

[in English] Baby, I thought you said
that you were gonna call.

I know. I had a late meeting.

Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

Can you leave it there?

Danki masha danki. Right?

Thank you. Sorry. Room service.

How many of those little cakes
have you eaten so far?

I can see our island from my room.

I miss you, bonita.

Franklin... what are we gonna do?

Christina, you can't just walk away
from these people.

I know you keep saying that,

but maybe... maybe we have
more options than we think.

What do you mean, ""more options""?

[Christina] You know things.
You know things about the organization.

- How things...
- [Franklin] Want me to be a rat?

You been talking to someone?
I told you...

[Christina] No, Franklin, we need to talk.
We really need to talk about the future.

[Franklin] We can't do this
on the phone, okay? I'll call later.

Rewind.

Okay.

[Franklin] I had a late meeting.

Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

Can you leave it there?

Danki masha danki. Right?

Thank you. Sorry. Room service.

[Peña] I think I might know where he is.

They probably set up shop
somewhere else after the raid.

[sighs]

[phone rings]

[Jorge] Salcedo.

[in Spanish] The Americans are back
on the accountant's office,

hoping he shows.

Knowing that idiot, he might.

If that's all they've got,
then they don't have much.

Stay on them.

Find out where they sleep at night.

All right.

Hey, boss. You doing okay?

You sound tired.

Yeah. I'm fine.

Keep me posted.

[school bell rings]

- [Paola] How was the science test?
- Good.

Daddy!

Daddy!

My princess. Hello, my princesses.
How are you all?

Hello. What are you doing here?

Hi, my love.

Was it your turn or mine
to pick up the girls?

Yours. I was in the neighborhood.
Just wanted to see how my girls are doing.

- Daddy, today we have piano lessons.
- I know, my love.

My little virtuosos.

And you? Everything okay?

I'm fine.

I just felt like I needed to see my girls.
That's why I came.

[phone ringing]

Excuse me.

Looks like I have to go.

Would you excuse me? Okay?

- Girls... I love you.
- Bye.

Bye, be good.

Salcedo.

- [David] Where are you?
- What can I do for you, David?

My dad called a meeting. Top personnel.

What do you mean, a meeting?
We just had one.

Well, we're having another one.

2611 Avenida 14. Out by Jamundí.
See you there.

[dialing tones]

[line ringing]

It's Carlo Córdova, leave a message.

Carlo, I just talked to David.

Are you on your way to the meeting?
Call me.

[Peña in English] Stoddard. Get this.

According to the language guy at SLS,
""Dasha masha danki""...

means ""Thank you very much"" in Papiamento.

Okay.

Curaçao.

Curaçao... I guess there's
a lot of banks there.

Yeah, there's a lot
of f*cking banks there. Here it is.

Baoase Luxury Resort.
Has an island villa you can rent.

Okay. What do we do then?

Call the Dutch Caribbean police
in Willemstad.

Ask them if they can confirm

anyone staying
under one of Franklin Jurado's aliases.

We got him, didn't we?

Not yet.

But he's there.

- Call them.
- Yeah.

[Amado] I'm sitting there,
enjoying my dick getting sucked,

when all of the sudden she stops.

I open my eyes and I ask her, ""What's up?""

She's all quiet, looking at me like this.

Not a word.

I'm like, ""What the f*ck?""
I turn to see Toque.

f*ck, he has a g*n pointed at him.
Like this.

And the other girl,
the one with the g*n, says to me:

""Give me the money,
or she bites your dick off.""

[both guffawing]

- So what did you do?
- I gave her the f*cking money!

I even tipped her, Pacho.

You don't mess around with that.

- You want some ice?
- Sure.

I'm having a great time.

I'm heading to Juárez tomorrow.

Got some business with my partners.

What am I going to tell them, Pacho?

I want to give them an answer.
Some good news.

My turn to tell you a story, Amado.

About the time my father
found me in my room with a boy.

Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.

My father told me I wasn't a man,
that I'd never be one.

It was the last time he spoke to me.

What a f*cking bastard.

For a long time, I thought he was right.

Even after I started working
for Gilberto and Miguel.

Up until the day some f*ck
told them I was a f*g.

And that it was a mistake
to let me be part of the business.

You know what they did?

They made me a partner.

Gilberto, Miguel, and Chepe,
they are my family.

I can't just leave them
when they need me the most.

[grunts]

What can I say?

I admire your loyalty.
You're one of a kind.

There you go.

[brakes screeching]

Don't want to be late.

What the f*ck is this?

Tell him what you did.

Tell him. Tell him where we caught you.

While you were visiting
your wife and children,

this f*cking rat
was on his way to the airport.

With his wife, bags packed.

About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

You had your bitch follow me?

- What did you say?
- Me? And my children?

You should be thankful, f*ck.

It's why you're standing there...
instead of sitting next to him.

You're making a big mistake, David.

I don't give a f*ck what you think.

He's a loyal man. He always has been.

- He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
- He's a good man and loyal.

- Good? Why was he running?
- What are you doing?

- This is a good man...
- He's a f*cking snitch!

Jorge!

Look at me.

Sophia is inside.

She's inside that room.

Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

She has nothing to do with this, brother.

These f*cking bastards are crazy.
They want to...

- David, no!
- [g*n]

Your friend was right, Jorge.

Go check on Sophia.

[water dripping]

My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

Because mistakes were made.

Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

These are the consequences.

Mistakes will not be tolerated.

Jorge, when he tried to run,

he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

Now... I trust you can take over
Córdova's responsibilities.

As our new head of security, Jorge.

What do you think?

I'm glad I can count on you.

[engine rumbling]

[panting]

My little girl, you're going to eat
a little bit of salad, okay?

Vera is going to teach you.
Look how much she ate.

Just a bit, sweetie.
Please, just eat a little bit.

I'm glad you called.

Are you okay?

Please don't lie to me.

If I do this, if I get my husband to...

You can protect us? We can go home?

You have my word.

I talked to him.

You did? That's good.

He's gonna... cooperate.

He said that?

Oh, no, not yet, but he will.
I just... I need a little time.

That's fine.
You take all the time you need.

And he made it work. He insisted on it.<br/>
<br/>
He made far more friends than enemies.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
I can help you expand your businesses...<br/>
<br/>
And he would count on those friends<br/>
to protect him.<br/>
<br/>
I could help you make millions.<br/>
<br/>
His retirement was going<br/>
to go his way, too.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn't going to die<br/>
on some shitty rooftop.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was s*ab him in the back,<br/>
nobody forcing him out.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, he was a man in control.<br/>
<br/>
The guy who never made<br/>
a wrong move in his life.<br/>
<br/>
A guy who built a billion-dollar empire,<br/>
brick by brick.<br/>
<br/>
A guy who owned every cop in town.<br/>
<br/>
A guy with a get-out-of-jail-free card<br/>
burning a hole in his pocket.<br/>
<br/>
And you want to go after him? Shit.<br/>
<br/>
You'd have to be crazy, stupid, brave,<br/>
and lucky all at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in Spanish]<br/>
Two units: Calderón's and mine.<br/>
<br/>
Breach one here. Breach two... here.<br/>
<br/>
Feistl, Van Ness: pool.<br/>
You come in from the back.<br/>
<br/>
- All right, let's do this already.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone k*ll the godfather, I k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
We can't repeat what happened<br/>
with Escobar. I want him alive.<br/>
<br/>
Understood?<br/>
<br/>
[Peña whispers] Go.<br/>
<br/>
- [in English] Nobody lives here, boss.<br/>
- That's bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Intel had Pacho here last night.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] What do you think?<br/>
What do we do?<br/>
<br/>
I think there could be hideouts here.<br/>
<br/>
- We have to check the house again.<br/>
- All right.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] We turn this place<br/>
upside down.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Men, we're going to search<br/>
every corner of this house, understood?<br/>
<br/>
It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know whose it is,<br/>
but it's not one of ours.<br/>
<br/>
Very good. Get out of there<br/>
and make sure no one sees you.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
[engine turns over]<br/>
<br/>
[phone rings]<br/>
<br/>
- Salcedo.<br/>
- [Miguel] Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Sir.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to do something important.<br/>
<br/>
When you leave your house,<br/>
you'll find Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
He knows where you have to go.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, sir, but what should I do<br/>
with the operation I'm monitoring?<br/>
<br/>
Córdova. Give it to Córdova.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge...<br/>
<br/>
- be careful.<br/>
- Of course, sir.<br/>
<br/>
He's one of my best men.<br/>
He'll take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
You're a man of your word.<br/>
<br/>
[Amado] Juárez.<br/>
<br/>
So close to heaven and so far from God.<br/>
<br/>
[Pacho] Impressive.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so glad you brought me<br/>
to see the eighth wonder of the world.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Don't be an assh*le, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
El Paso, Texas,<br/>
is what I wanted you to see.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking NAFTA changed everything, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
It's been around for what?<br/>
Two years, more or less?<br/>
<br/>
More than two million trucks<br/>
have crossed already, many of them ours.<br/>
<br/>
Filled to the brim.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how many trucks<br/>
the Americans check?<br/>
<br/>
Less than ten percent.<br/>
It's insane. They don't have the manpower.<br/>
<br/>
Assholes opened the floodgates<br/>
<br/>
and now they stand there<br/>
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it.<br/>
<br/>
This is the right business.<br/>
I already know this, man.<br/>
<br/>
No, man. What I'm saying is,<br/>
<br/>
you're getting out of the right business<br/>
at the exact wrong time.<br/>
<br/>
And you're going to regret it.<br/>
<br/>
You want some?<br/>
<br/>
Amado, are you suggesting<br/>
that I betray my partners?<br/>
<br/>
No. No way. Why betray?<br/>
They want to get out.<br/>
<br/>
I'm proposing that we start something new,<br/>
you and I.<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine it:<br/>
You send it to me, I get it across.<br/>
<br/>
In two years, we'll be flooding<br/>
this f*cking shitty country.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it, all right? Think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Just don't take too long,<br/>
because in six months,<br/>
<br/>
I need to secure a new supply.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, it will be with you.<br/>
<br/>
Hey...<br/>
<br/>
Give it another once-over?<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] It should be now.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Thirty seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
Hey! You can't park there!<br/>
<br/>
Damn truck.<br/>
<br/>
These f*cking trucks<br/>
are always breaking down.<br/>
<br/>
You can't park here.<br/>
<br/>
Let me just grab the cables<br/>
and I'll move it.<br/>
<br/>
Move the f*cking truck.<br/>
<br/>
[grunts]<br/>
<br/>
- [doorbell]<br/>
- That's the one Lady Di uses.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto!<br/>
<br/>
Someone's ringing the doorbell!<br/>
<br/>
[doorbell]<br/>
<br/>
- Careful.<br/>
- Sorry, wait just a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Let me get the door.<br/>
<br/>
Look.<br/>
<br/>
[doorbell]<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto?<br/>
<br/>
Police! Back up. Quickly! Move it!<br/>
<br/>
Quickly! Move it!<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, ladies.<br/>
Sit down, I won't say it again.<br/>
<br/>
You can't come in here. Get out.<br/>
<br/>
He's f*cking running!<br/>
<br/>
Get up! Look at my face!<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
- Sit down, miss.<br/>
- I already told you, Gilberto is not home.<br/>
<br/>
Did he contact anyone?<br/>
<br/>
- No one, Colonel.<br/>
- No? All good?<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant<br/>
signed and executed by myself,<br/>
<br/>
as representative<br/>
of the Colombian National Police.<br/>
<br/>
The question is, will you cooperate?<br/>
<br/>
[moaning]<br/>
<br/>
Are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
It's good here.<br/>
<br/>
[pager buzzes]<br/>
<br/>
The only thing left<br/>
is to demolish the house.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Okay. We're done. I'm calling it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my world.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Do what you need to wrap up,<br/>
have your men report back.<br/>
<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
- Feistl, anything else?<br/>
<br/>
- Ride to the airport?<br/>
- Sure.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Look, when we get there,<br/>
I think it's better if I go in alone.<br/>
<br/>
These people are angry.<br/>
<br/>
What we're asking of them,<br/>
it's an insult on top of their grief.<br/>
<br/>
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
Different? How?<br/>
<br/>
You're crippled. You don't carry a g*n.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don't carry g*n.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah... but you're not most people.<br/>
<br/>
And that's why it's so weird. Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
That you never carry a g*n.<br/>
<br/>
I see. Why do you think that is?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you're scared.<br/>
<br/>
Fear... of what you could do with it.<br/>
<br/>
That you've been walking around a k*ll<br/>
and never knew it.<br/>
<br/>
Pedrito, go in the house!<br/>
<br/>
Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.<br/>
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jorge Salcedo.<br/>
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.<br/>
<br/>
Go right back to where you came from<br/>
<br/>
and tell that whore<br/>
if she wants my grandson,<br/>
<br/>
she can come looking for him.<br/>
<br/>
I just came to talk.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like what I have to say,<br/>
<br/>
I'll go to Cali<br/>
and deliver whatever message you want.<br/>
<br/>
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.<br/>
<br/>
Your boss m*rder my son...<br/>
to take up with his whore wife.<br/>
<br/>
And now you come to take my grandson<br/>
far from the only family he has left.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not what you want to hear.<br/>
But she is his mother.<br/>
<br/>
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.<br/>
<br/>
Protecting?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what they call it now?<br/>
<br/>
And he will be protected as well.<br/>
<br/>
And if you let me take him back, I promise<br/>
you can see him whenever you'd like.<br/>
<br/>
You promise. How nice of you.<br/>
<br/>
Who told you I would do that?<br/>
<br/>
I have him here and I can see him<br/>
whenever I want and protect him.<br/>
<br/>
That bitch made her choice.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.<br/>
<br/>
The next men who come... won't be asking.<br/>
<br/>
There will be w*r.<br/>
<br/>
[car approaching]<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you ask my sons?<br/>
See what they think.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] If you don't mind, Capitán,<br/>
we need to stop by a friend's house.<br/>
<br/>
Make a right here.<br/>
<br/>
Nice neighborhood.<br/>
Your friend's very wealthy.<br/>
<br/>
He's a very fortunate man.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] What is this?<br/>
<br/>
[in English] My friend likes chickens.<br/>
<br/>
- [in Spanish] Colonel Martínez.<br/>
- Captain.<br/>
<br/>
You know what's happening here?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think I know.<br/>
<br/>
I'm giving you one chance<br/>
<br/>
to do the right thing<br/>
and not f*ck up this operation.<br/>
<br/>
You think you're clever?<br/>
<br/>
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.<br/>
This isn't Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
You're way out of line here, Hugo.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
He's here. We'll find him.<br/>
<br/>
Watch him.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] You got your kid's drawing?<br/>
<br/>
[Jorge in Spanish] I'm unarmed.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to send your head<br/>
back to Miguel in a f*cking box.<br/>
<br/>
- Walk, f*ck.<br/>
- Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
[Gerda] Duvan!<br/>
<br/>
Duvan!<br/>
<br/>
Bring out the car.<br/>
<br/>
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you<br/>
to your mother. Take my hand.<br/>
<br/>
- Very good.<br/>
- Shut your f*cking mouth or I k*ll her.<br/>
<br/>
All right, my lady.<br/>
Make like a statue or I sh**t your ass.<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting in first, you hear?<br/>
<br/>
Real still.<br/>
<br/>
You're taking the boy.<br/>
What else do you want?<br/>
<br/>
Relax.<br/>
<br/>
- Stop!<br/>
- Mama!<br/>
<br/>
What else, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
f*cking assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
[in English] f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Drop the w*apon.<br/>
<br/>
Drop the w*apon.<br/>
<br/>
Don't sh**t.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a man of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
[engine turns over]<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Stop!<br/>
<br/>
Colonel! Calderón took off.<br/>
<br/>
- [in English] f*ck. We move fast.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
- [in Spanish] You have a phone in there?<br/>
- Yes, in there.<br/>
<br/>
They got Gilberto, they're moving<br/>
towards the aerial base.<br/>
<br/>
The whole workforce is on this.<br/>
<br/>
They're not going to leave the city.<br/>
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Move it, assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
They'll try to take us on the road.<br/>
<br/>
g*n out!<br/>
<br/>
- [woman] Cleaning, cooking, working.<br/>
- [phone rings]<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
[Córdova]<br/>
Don Miguel... something's happened.<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
I'm outside Gilberto's house.<br/>
They got him. They got your brother.<br/>
<br/>
[man over radio] We've got a visual.<br/>
<br/>
Surround him in the market!<br/>
<br/>
[Calderón] Tail him!<br/>
<br/>
Look! There he goes! Faster!<br/>
<br/>
Let's get him on the next turn!<br/>
<br/>
Hold your f*re!<br/>
<br/>
Driver! Put your hands<br/>
where I can see them!<br/>
<br/>
Driver!<br/>
<br/>
Out further!<br/>
<br/>
Further!<br/>
<br/>
Get out.<br/>
<br/>
Open the back.<br/>
<br/>
- Okay. Let me get the keys.<br/>
- Open it.<br/>
<br/>
Open it.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Okay. All right. Settle.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] The American sons of bitches<br/>
tricked us. We've got the wrong truck!<br/>
<br/>
They're going to the air field.<br/>
We'll get them there.<br/>
<br/>
I took care of security.<br/>
<br/>
Let those sons of bitches<br/>
try to touch us again.<br/>
<br/>
Send Salcedo's beeper another message.<br/>
<br/>
[knock on door]<br/>
<br/>
[knock on door]<br/>
<br/>
Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!<br/>
<br/>
Come in.<br/>
<br/>
- Nicolas.<br/>
- Uncle.<br/>
<br/>
- Is it true?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
They got him.<br/>
<br/>
Nicolas, why don't you go home<br/>
and wait there?<br/>
<br/>
Once something happens, I'll call you.<br/>
<br/>
No, sir, I have to help.<br/>
<br/>
Come.<br/>
<br/>
You know your dad<br/>
doesn't want you mixed up in this.<br/>
<br/>
We have to have faith that your dad<br/>
won't be taken out of Cali.<br/>
<br/>
And if he is?<br/>
<br/>
Why did we waste all of that money<br/>
on my education? I'm a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
I want to help him.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope that's not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Wait here.<br/>
<br/>
[Van Ness]<br/>
What's up? Why'd we stop?<br/>
<br/>
There's cops surrounding the plane.<br/>
<br/>
Cops? Good ones?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
[officer in Spanish] Colonel Martínez.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, please don't come any closer.<br/>
<br/>
Your men are impeding the transport<br/>
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.<br/>
<br/>
You know it.<br/>
<br/>
And that means prison.<br/>
<br/>
What you do today...<br/>
<br/>
what you do this moment...<br/>
<br/>
defines you.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of your lives.<br/>
<br/>
Are you police or not?<br/>
<br/>
That's better.<br/>
<br/>
[whistles]<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Home stretch.<br/>
<br/>
[beeping]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Shit!<br/>
<br/>
[phone rings]<br/>
<br/>
[Jorge] What's up? It's me.<br/>
<br/>
- About f*cking time.<br/>
- I was out of range.<br/>
<br/>
They arrested Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
- What?<br/>
- They got him, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
They got Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
- You were monitoring the raid.<br/>
- But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.<br/>
<br/>
[Jorge] Even so, we checked<br/>
all the tapes. It's impossible.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't make sense!<br/>
<br/>
I just don't understand!<br/>
<br/>
Brother... they got him.<br/>
They took him away.<br/>
<br/>
We got b*at.<br/>
<br/>
Get back here quick.<br/>
<br/>
[dial tone]<br/>
<br/>
Hasta la vista, baby. Ciao.<br/>
<br/>
[Jorge] Take that.<br/>
<br/>
Five seconds to take photos, no more.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
But you know this won't hold up.<br/>
<br/>
You're f*cking with things<br/>
that are much bigger than you are.<br/>
<br/>
Smile, Gilberto. You're about to be on TV.<br/>
<br/>
This way, Mr. Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response<br/>
to the charges against you?<br/>
<br/>
Conspiring to export cocaine<br/>
and illegal enrichment?<br/>
<br/>
Enough. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have anything to say<br/>
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in English] For those of us<br/>
who thought the surrender was bullshit,<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto's arrest proved<br/>
that these guys could be caught.<br/>
<br/>
For the people who thought the surrender<br/>
was the only way to avoid v*olence,<br/>
<br/>
it was the beginning of a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
The first sh*t in a w*r<br/>
to bring down another cartel.<br/>
<br/>
But whatever side you fell on,<br/>
one thing was clear:<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest<br/>
came as a surprise to everybody.<br/>
<br/>
Especially him.<br/>
<br/>
Don Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, congrats.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations. Good work.<br/>
<br/>
No, where you going?<br/>
Come on, we want to toast you!<br/>
<br/>
Start without me.<br/>
<br/>
[man] Great work!<br/>
<br/>
- Mr. Ambassador.<br/>
- Big day.<br/>
<br/>
- Quite a notch on your belt.<br/>
- It was strong intel, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- I acted...<br/>
- Know how much work you torched?<br/>
<br/>
People want to see<br/>
the godfathers in handcuffs<br/>
<br/>
and that's what they're gonna get.<br/>
<br/>
- Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.<br/>
- Colombians may not feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go find out.<br/>
<br/>
Get changed.<br/>
<br/>
- [in Spanish] My love!<br/>
- Mommy!<br/>
<br/>
Mommy.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you hungry? No?<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
Mom will read you a story in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
[María] Go. I'll be right there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, we don't know how much the DEA knows.<br/>
<br/>
We need to assume<br/>
all your current homes are... unsafe.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stay here for now.<br/>
<br/>
We all need to talk.<br/>
<br/>
What did you expect? A warrant<br/>
by definition authorizes the police...<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
This operation was run<br/>
by the Drug Enforcement Administration<br/>
<br/>
of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,<br/>
was National Police.<br/>
<br/>
The transport was by our police.<br/>
The booking was by our police.<br/>
<br/>
So a w*r started by National Police?<br/>
<br/>
Look, as Attorney General,<br/>
<br/>
my main... concern is achieving<br/>
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.<br/>
<br/>
And the arrest<br/>
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela<br/>
<br/>
means we now have new leverage<br/>
to negotiate with.<br/>
<br/>
The President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to be late to a good debate.<br/>
<br/>
You know us, might as well<br/>
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.<br/>
<br/>
I've been apprised by Minister Botero<br/>
<br/>
about our newly-incarcerated<br/>
Cali godfather.<br/>
<br/>
- With all due respect, Mr. President?<br/>
- Go ahead, Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
We've worked for months<br/>
to negotiate this surrender.<br/>
<br/>
We recommend the immediate release<br/>
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.<br/>
<br/>
Colombia is a nation of laws.<br/>
<br/>
Not of concessions.<br/>
<br/>
If I give a pass to the largest criminal<br/>
organization in the world...<br/>
<br/>
the trust of the people<br/>
will be lost forever.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Rodríguez is entitled<br/>
to the same due process<br/>
<br/>
as any Colombian citizen.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see where due process gets him.<br/>
<br/>
For now...<br/>
<br/>
his arrest stands.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] f*ck' A.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about this.<br/>
I don't want the stink of this on you.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one<br/>
in the family who can visit you.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I thought you could use<br/>
a friendly face.<br/>
<br/>
What I could really use<br/>
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.<br/>
<br/>
How's it look?<br/>
<br/>
The warrants are old.<br/>
<br/>
- Invalid?<br/>
- Vulnerable.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.<br/>
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.<br/>
<br/>
8:00 a.m., latest, I'm out.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, you're here until our lawyers<br/>
get you in front of a judge.<br/>
<br/>
And he'll hold you here in Bogotá<br/>
due to the conspiracy charge.<br/>
<br/>
I don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
This is a mistake, a blunder.<br/>
<br/>
A gross overstep<br/>
by a rogue American agent!<br/>
<br/>
That's what you want to believe.<br/>
<br/>
But if that was the case,<br/>
you'd be out by now.<br/>
<br/>
- Dad, this is real.<br/>
- No, money is real.<br/>
<br/>
And what about all I've paid?<br/>
<br/>
Sons of bitches<br/>
can't leave me confined here.<br/>
<br/>
[David] How the f*ck did they surprise us<br/>
like that, gentlemen?<br/>
<br/>
It was Calderón.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
- And his f*cking family and his children.<br/>
- [Miguel] David, please.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, there's responsibility<br/>
on all sides.<br/>
<br/>
- Córdova...<br/>
- Sir, just as we realized...<br/>
<br/>
By the time you realized,<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Martínez had already been<br/>
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to the DEA,<br/>
Córdova counts on me.<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Córdova, you're my brother's<br/>
personal head of security.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Then you should've been there.<br/>
<br/>
Your men should've been there.<br/>
<br/>
Your guards were fooled<br/>
by a f*cking chicken truck.<br/>
<br/>
I want to know what the f*ck<br/>
is happening here.<br/>
<br/>
Because I'm starting to believe<br/>
that none of us are safe.<br/>
<br/>
Not your families...<br/>
<br/>
and not mine.<br/>
<br/>
My family.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,<br/>
Defense Minister Botero.<br/>
<br/>
[in English]<br/>
Today marks an important beginning,<br/>
<br/>
an important victory.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the success<br/>
of our Colombian-American operation...<br/>
<br/>
the Cali cartel is on the run.<br/>
<br/>
And with the continued support<br/>
of the Colombian National Police...<br/>
<br/>
I promise you...<br/>
the other three godfathers will fall.<br/>
<br/>
Questions?<br/>
<br/>
That's as much recognition<br/>
as we can hope for, right?<br/>
<br/>
None at all? Smart move.<br/>
<br/>
Keep his face all over this<br/>
while we're closing in.<br/>
<br/>
Kiss-ass.<br/>
<br/>
Want some?<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm moving tables.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, boy.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, God.<br/>
<br/>
Can't believe you're eating that shit.<br/>
<br/>
[knock on door]<br/>
<br/>
[Peña in Spanish] Colonel, please.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Have a drink with me.<br/>
<br/>
[Peña sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, we celebrate.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, we go back to work.<br/>
<br/>
Well, not for me.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
[in English] You remember those papers<br/>
that were seized by your men in Cali?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we never saw those.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, Vargas did.<br/>
<br/>
And there was a list of cops<br/>
who've been accepting money from Cali.<br/>
<br/>
One name he was eager to share: mine.<br/>
<br/>
Those son of a bitches<br/>
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly. It sends a message to any cop<br/>
who wants to try what we did.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
I turned in my w*apon and my badge.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel...<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Men like me would give our lives<br/>
to arrest a man like him.<br/>
<br/>
You did everything right, Peña.<br/>
<br/>
But now you're all alone.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Take care.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
We need to talk about your security.<br/>
<br/>
Let me be in charge.<br/>
<br/>
I'll protect you, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Now's not the time for a change.<br/>
<br/>
We need to keep things on track<br/>
until your uncle is back.<br/>
<br/>
What if he doesn't come back?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
- They got Gilberto.<br/>
- [Pacho] I don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Gilberto<br/>
had this all under control.<br/>
<br/>
So did I.<br/>
<br/>
And what now?<br/>
<br/>
This could get messy.<br/>
<br/>
Stay where you are.<br/>
Right now, we look out for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Pacho... be smart.<br/>
<br/>
For now, we wait.<br/>
<br/>
You stay there a while longer.<br/>
<br/>
We have to keep everything running.<br/>
<br/>
The health of the business<br/>
has never been more important. Understand?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Of course.<br/>
<br/>
You listening to me, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
[in English]<br/>
Hey, listen, buddy, I don't speak Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
No speak Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?<br/>
<br/>
The Jurado tapes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we probably shouldn't call them that<br/>
because they're not legal, per se.<br/>
<br/>
I want all of them.<br/>

[""Adiós"" playing]</div>]","[engine turns over]

[Peña in Spanish] Please, pay attention!

I need you to put your cell phones,
beepers, and radios in the container.

[in English]
Is this necessary, Agent Peña?

- I'm afraid so, Captain.
- [in Spanish] Please. I'll take that.

[in English] One of my guys
says one of your guys

is working for the cartel.

They have any proof?

Can't say yet.

But this warrant will be hard to execute
if they're one step ahead.

It's just a precaution.

- Gracias.
- Okay.

[in Spanish] For the next three hours,
we'll be running silent.

- My colleagues and I will take the lead.
- And the target?

I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

[in English] We're advisors.
We work together, same as always.

Credit's all yours.

[in Spanish] Gentlemen, you heard!
I need you to be tight and right.

- Understood?
- [together] Yes, sir!

Let's go.

[in English]
In case you're confused, Capitán,

I wouldn't have come all the way
from Bogotá if it wasn't a big deal.

My men's safety. That's what I care about.

I make the final call
if anything feels off.

You follow?

My kid gave it to me
right before I went out on this buy-bust.

Some Jamaican took a rip at me,
missed by that much, so...

I rub it for luck ever since.

[in Spanish] So, what are we doing here?

We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

[theme music playing]

[TV announcer in Spanish] Applauded
by the multitude present on 10th street,

president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano
is welcomed by the people of Colombia...

[Peña in English] I don't give
Gilberto Rodríguez credit for much,

but I have to hand it to him...

[Aura chuckles]

...he was a man in control.

[in Spanish] It's too early.

- I rise early. I'm up with the sun.
- Up all right!

[Peña in English]
He was married to three women.

At the same time.

And he managed them the same way
he ran his business.

Scheduled down to the minute.

[""Going Back to Cali"" playing]

Wife number three got him
Monday and Tuesday.

[in Spanish] Hi!

How did it go, honey?

Very good! Look, what a beauty.

[woman moaning]

[Peña in English] Number two...

got him Wednesday and Thursday.

And wife number one
got him on Friday and Saturday.

[man on TV in Spanish]
Look at that pass. Goal!

Damn it, what sort of defense is that?
Piece of shit!

I'm paying your f*cking salaries!

[Peña in English]
Sundays were for football.

[doorbell]

All the wives were invited
if they wanted to come.

They usually did.

[in Spanish] Thank you.

And they all got along.

That was the deal.

And he made it work. He insisted on it.

He made far more friends than enemies.

[in Spanish]
I can help you expand your businesses...

And he would count on those friends
to protect him.

I could help you make millions.

His retirement was going
to go his way, too.

He wasn't going to die
on some shitty rooftop.

Nobody was s*ab him in the back,
nobody forcing him out.

Like I said, he was a man in control.

The guy who never made
a wrong move in his life.

A guy who built a billion-dollar empire,
brick by brick.

A guy who owned every cop in town.

A guy with a get-out-of-jail-free card
burning a hole in his pocket.

And you want to go after him? Shit.

You'd have to be crazy, stupid, brave,
and lucky all at the same time.

[Peña in Spanish]
Two units: Calderón's and mine.

Breach one here. Breach two... here.

Feistl, Van Ness: pool.
You come in from the back.

- All right, let's do this already.
- Okay.

If anyone k*ll the godfather, I k*ll you.

We can't repeat what happened
with Escobar. I want him alive.

Understood?

[Peña whispers] Go.

- [in English] Nobody lives here, boss.
- That's bullshit.

Intel had Pacho here last night.

[in Spanish] What do you think?
What do we do?

I think there could be hideouts here.

- We have to check the house again.
- All right.

[in English] We turn this place
upside down.

[in Spanish] Men, we're going to search
every corner of this house, understood?

It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.

I don't know whose it is,
but it's not one of ours.

Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

Yes, sir.

[engine turns over]

[phone rings]

- Salcedo.
- [Miguel] Jorge.

Sir.

I need you to do something important.

When you leave your house,
you'll find Navegante.

He knows where you have to go.

Of course, sir, but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

Córdova. Give it to Córdova.

Jorge...

- be careful.
- Of course, sir.

He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

You're a man of your word.

[Amado] Juárez.

So close to heaven and so far from God.

[Pacho] Impressive.

I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

[chuckles]

Don't be an assh*le, Pacho.

El Paso, Texas,
is what I wanted you to see.

f*cking NAFTA changed everything, Pacho.

It's been around for what?
Two years, more or less?

More than two million trucks
have crossed already, many of them ours.

Filled to the brim.

Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

Less than ten percent.
It's insane. They don't have the manpower.

Assholes opened the floodgates

and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it.

This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

No, man. What I'm saying is,

you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

And you're going to regret it.

You want some?

Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

No. No way. Why betray?
They want to get out.

I'm proposing that we start something new,
you and I.

Just imagine it:
You send it to me, I get it across.

In two years, we'll be flooding
this f*cking shitty country.

Think about it, all right? Think about it.

Just don't take too long,
because in six months,

I need to secure a new supply.

Hopefully, it will be with you.

Hey...

Give it another once-over?

Okay.

[in English] It should be now.

[in Spanish] Thirty seconds.

Hey!

Hey! You can't park there!

Damn truck.

These f*cking trucks
are always breaking down.

You can't park here.

Let me just grab the cables
and I'll move it.

Move the f*cking truck.

[grunts]

- [doorbell]
- That's the one Lady Di uses.

Gilberto!

Someone's ringing the doorbell!

[doorbell]

- Careful.
- Sorry, wait just a moment.

Let me get the door.

Look.

[doorbell]

Gilberto?

Police! Back up. Quickly! Move it!

Quickly! Move it!

What's going on?

Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, I won't say it again.

You can't come in here. Get out.

He's f*cking running!

Get up! Look at my face!

Let's go.

- Sit down, miss.
- I already told you, Gilberto is not home.

Did he contact anyone?

- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

Mrs. Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

The question is, will you cooperate?

[moaning]

Are you all right?

Yes.

It's good here.

[pager buzzes]

The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

Yeah. Okay. We're done. I'm calling it.

I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

Welcome to my world.

Well...

[in English] Do what you need to wrap up,
have your men report back.

- Okay.
- Feistl, anything else?

- Ride to the airport?
- Sure.

[in Spanish] Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

These people are angry.

What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

Different? How?

You're crippled. You don't carry a g*n.

Most people don't carry g*n.

Yeah... but you're not most people.

And that's why it's so weird. Interesting.

That you never carry a g*n.

I see. Why do you think that is?

I don't know.

Maybe you're scared.

Fear... of what you could do with it.

That you've been walking around a k*ll
and never knew it.

Pedrito, go in the house!

Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

Go right back to where you came from

and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

she can come looking for him.

I just came to talk.

If you don't like what I have to say,

I'll go to Cali
and deliver whatever message you want.

I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

Your boss m*rder my son...
to take up with his whore wife.

And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

Protecting?

Is that what they call it now?

And he will be protected as well.

And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

You promise. How nice of you.

Who told you I would do that?

I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

That bitch made her choice.

Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

The next men who come... won't be asking.

There will be w*r.

[car approaching]

Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

[in English] If you don't mind, Capitán,
we need to stop by a friend's house.

Make a right here.

Nice neighborhood.
Your friend's very wealthy.

He's a very fortunate man.

[in Spanish] What is this?

[in English] My friend likes chickens.

- [in Spanish] Colonel Martínez.
- Captain.

You know what's happening here?

Yes, I think I know.

I'm giving you one chance

to do the right thing
and not f*ck up this operation.

You think you're clever?

You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotá.

You're way out of line here, Hugo.

Perhaps.

He's here. We'll find him.

Watch him.

[in English] You got your kid's drawing?

[Jorge in Spanish] I'm unarmed.

We're going to send your head
back to Miguel in a f*cking box.

- Walk, f*ck.
- Let's go.

[Gerda] Duvan!

Duvan!

Bring out the car.

Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

- Very good.
- Shut your f*cking mouth or I k*ll her.

All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I sh**t your ass.

I'm getting in first, you hear?

Real still.

You're taking the boy.
What else do you want?

Relax.

- Stop!
- Mama!

What else, f*ck?

f*cking assh*le!

[in English] f*ck!

[in Spanish] Drop the w*apon.

Drop the w*apon.

Don't sh**t.

I'm a man of peace.

Let's go.

[engine turns over]

Hey! Stop!

Colonel! Calderón took off.

- [in English] f*ck. We move fast.
- Okay.

- [in Spanish] You have a phone in there?
- Yes, in there.

They got Gilberto, they're moving
towards the aerial base.

The whole workforce is on this.

They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?

Move it, assh*le.

They'll try to take us on the road.

g*n out!

- [woman] Cleaning, cooking, working.
- [phone rings]

Hello.

[Córdova]
Don Miguel... something's happened.

What happened?

I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

[man over radio] We've got a visual.

Surround him in the market!

[Calderón] Tail him!

Look! There he goes! Faster!

Let's get him on the next turn!

Hold your f*re!

Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

Driver!

Out further!

Further!

Get out.

Open the back.

- Okay. Let me get the keys.
- Open it.

Open it.

[in English] Okay. All right. Settle.

[in Spanish] The American sons of bitches
tricked us. We've got the wrong truck!

They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

I took care of security.

Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

Send Salcedo's beeper another message.

[knock on door]

[knock on door]

Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

Come in.

- Nicolas.
- Uncle.

- Is it true?
- Yes.

They got him.

Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

Once something happens, I'll call you.

No, sir, I have to help.

Come.

You know your dad
doesn't want you mixed up in this.

We have to have faith that your dad
won't be taken out of Cali.

And if he is?

Why did we waste all of that money
on my education? I'm a lawyer.

I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.

I want to help him.

Let's hope that's not necessary.

[in English] f*ck.

Wait here.

[Van Ness]
What's up? Why'd we stop?

There's cops surrounding the plane.

Cops? Good ones?

I don't think so.

[officer in Spanish] Colonel Martínez.

Sir, please don't come any closer.

Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

You know it.

And that means prison.

What you do today...

what you do this moment...

defines you.

For the rest of your lives.

Are you police or not?

That's better.

[whistles]

[in English] Home stretch.

[beeping]

[in Spanish] Shit!

[phone rings]

[Jorge] What's up? It's me.

- About f*cking time.
- I was out of range.

They arrested Gilberto.

- What?
- They got him, Jorge.

They got Gilberto.

- You were monitoring the raid.
- But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.

[Jorge] Even so, we checked
all the tapes. It's impossible.

It doesn't make sense!

I just don't understand!

Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

We got b*at.

Get back here quick.

[dial tone]

Hasta la vista, baby. Ciao.

[Jorge] Take that.

Five seconds to take photos, no more.

Congratulations.

But you know this won't hold up.

You're f*cking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

Smile, Gilberto. You're about to be on TV.

This way, Mr. Rodríguez.

Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

Enough. Let's go.

Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodríguez.

[Peña in English] For those of us
who thought the surrender was bullshit,

Gilberto's arrest proved
that these guys could be caught.

For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid v*olence,

it was the beginning of a nightmare.

The first sh*t in a w*r
to bring down another cartel.

But whatever side you fell on,
one thing was clear:

Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

Especially him.

Don Gilberto.

Hey, congrats.

Congratulations. Good work.

No, where you going?
Come on, we want to toast you!

Start without me.

[man] Great work!

- Mr. Ambassador.
- Big day.

- Quite a notch on your belt.
- It was strong intel, sir.

- I acted...
- Know how much work you torched?

People want to see
the godfathers in handcuffs

and that's what they're gonna get.

- Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
- Colombians may not feel that way.

Let's go find out.

Get changed.

- [in Spanish] My love!
- Mommy!

Mommy.

- Are you hungry? No?
- No.

How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

Come on.
Mom will read you a story in a bit.

[María] Go. I'll be right there.

Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

Sir, we don't know how much the DEA knows.

We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

I'll stay here for now.

We all need to talk.

What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorizes the police...

Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

of the United States.

The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

So a w*r started by National Police?

Look, as Attorney General,

my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

The President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper.

I hate to be late to a good debate.

You know us, might as well
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.

I've been apprised by Minister Botero

about our newly-incarcerated
Cali godfather.

- With all due respect, Mr. President?
- Go ahead, Miguel.

We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.

Colombia is a nation of laws.

Not of concessions.

If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organization in the world...

the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

Mr. Rodríguez is entitled
to the same due process

as any Colombian citizen.

Let's see where due process gets him.

For now...

his arrest stands.

Thank you, gentlemen.

[in English] f*ck' A.

[in Spanish] Thank you very much.

We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

Relax, Dad.

I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

Besides, I thought you could use
a friendly face.

What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

How's it look?

The warrants are old.

- Invalid?
- Vulnerable.

I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

8:00 a.m., latest, I'm out.

Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

And he'll hold you here in Bogotá
due to the conspiracy charge.

I don't get it.

This is a mistake, a blunder.

A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

That's what you want to believe.

But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

- Dad, this is real.
- No, money is real.

And what about all I've paid?

Sons of bitches
can't leave me confined here.

[David] How the f*ck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

It was Calderón.

Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

- And his f*cking family and his children.
- [Miguel] David, please.

Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

- Córdova...
- Sir, just as we realized...

By the time you realized,

Colonel Martínez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

When it comes to the DEA,
Córdova counts on me.

Wait. Córdova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

Yes, sir.

Then you should've been there.

Your men should've been there.

Your guards were fooled
by a f*cking chicken truck.

I want to know what the f*ck
is happening here.

Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us are safe.

Not your families...

and not mine.

My family.

Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defense Minister Botero.

[in English]
Today marks an important beginning,

an important victory.

Because of the success
of our Colombian-American operation...

the Cali cartel is on the run.

And with the continued support
of the Colombian National Police...

I promise you...
the other three godfathers will fall.

Questions?

That's as much recognition
as we can hope for, right?

None at all? Smart move.

Keep his face all over this
while we're closing in.

Kiss-ass.

Want some?

No, I'm moving tables.

Oh, boy.

Oh, God.

Can't believe you're eating that shit.

[knock on door]

[Peña in Spanish] Colonel, please.

Thanks.

[in English] Have a drink with me.

[Peña sighs]

Tonight, we celebrate.

Tomorrow, we go back to work.

Well, not for me.

[in Spanish] What are you talking about?

[in English] You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

Yeah, we never saw those.

Apparently, Vargas did.

And there was a list of cops
who've been accepting money from Cali.

One name he was eager to share: mine.

Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

Exactly. It sends a message to any cop
who wants to try what we did.

[in Spanish]
I turned in my w*apon and my badge.

Good luck.

Colonel...

I'm sorry.

Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

You did everything right, Peña.

But now you're all alone.

[in English] Take care.

[in Spanish]
We need to talk about your security.

Let me be in charge.

I'll protect you, Dad.

Now's not the time for a change.

We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

What if he doesn't come back?

[""La Gloria Eres Tú"" playing]

[Paola] Jorge.

Jorge.

- They got Gilberto.
- [Pacho] I don't understand.

I thought Gilberto
had this all under control.

So did I.

And what now?

This could get messy.

Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.

Pacho... be smart.

For now, we wait.

You stay there a while longer.

We have to keep everything running.

The health of the business
has never been more important. Understand?

Yes. Of course.

You listening to me, f*ck?

[in English]
Hey, listen, buddy, I don't speak Spanish.

No speak Spanish.

Okay.

Have a nice day.

Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

The Jurado tapes.

Well, we probably shouldn't call them that
because they're not legal, per se.

I want all of them.

<br/>
The Lord of the Skies!<br/>
<br/>
How f*cking elegant, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't tease. - God damn, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Your little brother? - Yes. Alvaro.<br/>
<br/>
Come here, son.<br/>
<br/>
- You also get a hug. - Sir.<br/>
<br/>
How are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
320 million kinds of okay.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't it smell like the f*cking U.S. Treasury in here?<br/>
<br/>
- This half is yours. - Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget it.<br/>
<br/>
All right. We came at a good time, then.<br/>
<br/>
A Tuesday like any other, Pacho. You know how it is.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Let's go to the house. - Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Son, do you like margaritas?<br/>
<br/>
Of course I do.<br/>
<br/>
Great, because I have a Margarita for you.<br/>
<br/>
She'll suck you dry.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Mexico, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Take the money and destroy the plane.<br/>
<br/>
First off, Senator Martin and I would like to thank you<br/>
<br/>
for having us down, Ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
But, you gotta know what's going on in Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Folks are wondering if we're gonna win this thing.<br/>
<br/>
And as senior members of the Appropriations Committee,<br/>
<br/>
those questions are directed at us.<br/>
<br/>
Now, everyone's proud of the work you guys did to bring down Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
And it's particularly an honor to meet you, Agent Peña.<br/>
<br/>
But cocaine continues to flow north, and the American people wonder<br/>
<br/>
if the Colombians share our enthusiasm to take this thr*at head-on.<br/>
<br/>
Our colleague, Senator Helms, put forward some tough language on them.<br/>
<br/>
But we wanted to come down here and get the real from you all.<br/>
<br/>
See firsthand what's at stake.<br/>
<br/>
See how and... if we can give you all the support you need.<br/>
<br/>
Let's extend the senators every courtesy while they're here.<br/>
<br/>
Their mission is a priority.<br/>
<br/>
They ask... you answer.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Money makes the world go 'round.<br/>
<br/>
Legal or illegal, good guys and bad guys, we all chase money.<br/>
<br/>
For the DEA, it's about budget meetings and kissing the right ass<br/>
<br/>
to keep the funding flowing.<br/>
<br/>
But if you're a tr*ffick, getting the money is easy.<br/>
<br/>
It's holding onto it that's hard.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days, cash was flown back to Colombia<br/>
<br/>
on the same planes that carried coke into the States.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was converted into pesos, or, if you were Pablo Escobar,<br/>
<br/>
stuck in a hole somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
One tr*ffick died with so much cash buried on his property, when it rained,<br/>
<br/>
the river downstream became clogged with bills that had washed free.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with illegal money is the trail that it leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, American banks would take your money, no questions asked.<br/>
<br/>
That changed when President Nixon signed the Bank Secrecy Act,<br/>
<br/>
requiring all U.S. banks to report transactions<br/>
<br/>
involving more than $10,000 in cash.<br/>
<br/>
And from that law, money laundering was born.<br/>
<br/>
The first stage of money laundering is called placement,<br/>
<br/>
and Cali had it down to an art.<br/>
<br/>
Bringing workers from the comunas to the U.S.,<br/>
<br/>
where their job was to buy money orders,<br/>
<br/>
each just under ten grand, so they wouldn't be reported.<br/>
<br/>
No I.D. was required.<br/>
<br/>
And the orders could even remain blank until they were deposited or cashed.<br/>
<br/>
Once they bought a bunch of money orders,<br/>
<br/>
they packed them up and sent them south<br/>
<br/>
to a land of sunshine and lax oversight.<br/>
<br/>
Panama.<br/>
<br/>
Since they didn't regulate wire transfers, Panama was the perfect place<br/>
<br/>
for the second stage of money laundering: Layering.<br/>
<br/>
And here's where the master goes to work.<br/>
<br/>
The behind the scenes MVP of any drug cartel is the money launderer,<br/>
<br/>
the guy that takes the dirty money and scrubs it clean. Here's how:<br/>
<br/>
The money orders were deposited into local bank accounts,<br/>
<br/>
and then bounced through shell companies and limited partnerships,<br/>
<br/>
creating an untraceable web of phony purchase orders and transaction reports,<br/>
<br/>
wiping clean the money's criminal origins.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter how well you hide it, money always leaves a trail.<br/>
<br/>
And the best way to hurt the Cali cartel was to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Cali. Muy hermosa, right?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck you, Chris.<br/>
<br/>
The man asked me if I had a partner, and your desk is across from mine.<br/>
<br/>
You really f*cked me, man.<br/>
<br/>
You gonna ride a desk all the way to Special Operations Unit?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.<br/>
<br/>
Agents Feistl, Van Ness...?<br/>
<br/>
- Feistl. - Welcome to Cali.<br/>
<br/>
- Gracias. - Captain Calderón.<br/>
<br/>
We're happy to be here.<br/>
<br/>
And what brings you to Cali?<br/>
<br/>
We've got some addresses we want to investigate.<br/>
<br/>
Cartel-related?<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
What a surprise. DEA agents that don't trust us.<br/>
<br/>
How did that work out for the last two guys?<br/>
<br/>
Friend, in Cali, there are more corrupt cops than there are churches.<br/>
<br/>
You don't trust me? I understand.<br/>
<br/>
But if you want to get anything done in Cali, you need the police's help.<br/>
<br/>
If not me, someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Not my rule.<br/>
<br/>
- I understand. - Good.<br/>
<br/>
The addresses are linked to cartel financial operations.<br/>
<br/>
We want to put eyes on them. See if any of the dots start connecting...<br/>
<br/>
You've come a long way to connect dots.<br/>
<br/>
We work with what we've got.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you can tell me where I can find Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
If they didn't own half of the city, I couldn't even be sure they exist.<br/>
<br/>
The Rodríguez brothers are ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
It was true.<br/>
<br/>
While the terms of surrender were being finalized,<br/>
<br/>
the brothers had gone underground to avoid capture.<br/>
<br/>
They abandoned their swank estates, secretly moving to new homes,<br/>
<br/>
where they could continue running their empire<br/>
<br/>
without setting foot in one of their legitimate businesses.<br/>
<br/>
And all this while Chepe continued to expand their New York operation.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes, even the best get unlucky.<br/>
<br/>
A computer glitch in Monaco led authorities to notice<br/>
<br/>
that one limited partnership had multiple accounts at the same bank.<br/>
<br/>
When they looked closer,<br/>
<br/>
they found it had ties to hundreds of bullshit accounts across Europe.<br/>
<br/>
And they all led back to one bank...<br/>
<br/>
right here in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky for us, the president had given the DEA our best w*apon yet:<br/>
<br/>
The Clinton list.<br/>
<br/>
If we suspected a company of working with tr*ffick,<br/>
<br/>
their name went on the list.<br/>
<br/>
And then they were banned from doing business with U.S. companies<br/>
<br/>
and U.S. companies were banned from doing business with them.<br/>
<br/>
You get f*cked both ways.<br/>
<br/>
And you want to know what the best part is?<br/>
<br/>
We don't even have to prove it.<br/>
<br/>
We just... put you on the list.<br/>
<br/>
And the OFAC takes care of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
How can I help you, Agent Peña?<br/>
<br/>
Armed with the thr*at of the Clinton list,<br/>
<br/>
we could get pretty much any information we wanted,<br/>
<br/>
and that's how we were able to give.<br/>
<br/>
Cali's number one money launderer a name:<br/>
<br/>
Franklin Jurado.<br/>
<br/>
Because it was illegal for Colombian citizens<br/>
<br/>
to have U.S. currency in their possession,<br/>
<br/>
a money launderer became more than just a connection<br/>
<br/>
to the financial institutions that washed their cash.<br/>
<br/>
For all intents and purposes, he is their money.<br/>
<br/>
Jurado was the perfect bridge between the narcos<br/>
<br/>
and the world of high finance.<br/>
<br/>
He spoke five languages and traveled on multiple passports.<br/>
<br/>
He married an American girl he met while at business school in the States,<br/>
<br/>
took her down south, and got her in on his action.<br/>
<br/>
That American passport was solid gold in any Caribbean bank.<br/>
<br/>
Jurado was smooth. But now, we knew his name.<br/>
<br/>
These are cash transfers.<br/>
<br/>
The accounts are controlled by a man named Franklin Jurado.<br/>
<br/>
- You know him? - Of him.<br/>
<br/>
He served as director at Interamericas.<br/>
<br/>
- The Rodríguez brothers' bank. - Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
They later gave him a more important job.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an address for Jurado?<br/>
<br/>
I can get it for you.<br/>
<br/>
So what happened since the last time I saw you?<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to take these men on, or what?<br/>
<br/>
- I'm going to do my job. - And your bosses?<br/>
<br/>
Do they know what you're doing?<br/>
<br/>
No comment.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking...<br/>
<br/>
maybe I could come with you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, come on, this could be our last chance to travel like we used to.<br/>
<br/>
- Remember that place in Milan? - With the leaking roof?<br/>
<br/>
On your birthday. And that terrible risotto.<br/>
<br/>
That balcony.<br/>
<br/>
The brothers are pushing now, baby. They are opening more accounts.<br/>
<br/>
- It's dangerous. - I don't care.<br/>
<br/>
How high are you right now?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, f*ck you!<br/>
<br/>
Give me your passport.<br/>
<br/>
I can't stay in this apartment anymore, Franklin.<br/>
<br/>
I can't watch another movie with subtitles by myself.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to listen to the cartel wives talk about their husbands...<br/>
<br/>
- With an English degree from Harvard... - Please don't tell me I can teach.<br/>
<br/>
Then what did you want me to say?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
We'll do this another time.<br/>
<br/>
The dining room is over here.<br/>
<br/>
You have a room over here.<br/>
<br/>
You have another one over here.<br/>
<br/>
And here, you have the living room.<br/>
<br/>
The dimmer is over here.<br/>
<br/>
And you can adjust the light.<br/>
<br/>
Well... you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
- No. I don't understand. - What don't you understand?<br/>
<br/>
Does this seem normal to you?<br/>
<br/>
You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez<br/>
<br/>
you were uncertain about returning to the North Valley.<br/>
<br/>
And that's why he bought me a palace. With dimmers.<br/>
<br/>
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,<br/>
<br/>
but I need to think about his generous offer.<br/>
<br/>
We have that dinner tonight.<br/>
<br/>
With your friends?<br/>
<br/>
With the investors.<br/>
<br/>
They're not going to like the six-month delay.<br/>
<br/>
And I think it's best if we don't mention the Rodríguez brothers by name.<br/>
<br/>
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.<br/>
<br/>
I know you did it for your family.<br/>
<br/>
But if these people like everything they hear tonight,<br/>
<br/>
you'll have your own security firm the second these six months are up.<br/>
<br/>
- Ready! - Good!<br/>
<br/>
A choir!<br/>
<br/>
All right, say bye to Dad. We're leaving.<br/>
<br/>
- Bye. - Bye.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.<br/>
<br/>
Will you make it on time?<br/>
<br/>
If you're wearing the dress with the flowers, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, girls.<br/>
<br/>
Today is a busy day for us, boys.<br/>
<br/>
Bosses have meetings all day at the National Hotel.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to pre-sweep each and every location on this schedule.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked like bullshit, blocking escape routes.<br/>
<br/>
He's looking at you, Montez.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.<br/>
<br/>
Don Miguel's team on channel six. Don Gilberto's, channel eight.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.<br/>
<br/>
They're working with the National Police.<br/>
<br/>
But they don't have warrants. They're tourists.<br/>
<br/>
They need permission to wipe their own asses.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, while they're in Cali, we'll be watching them.<br/>
<br/>
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother. - Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
That's all, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.<br/>
<br/>
I have to duck out early. It's a work thing for Paola.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to practice your English?<br/>
<br/>
Starkman, the American lawyer, arrives today.<br/>
<br/>
Can you pick him up from the airport?<br/>
<br/>
Aren't you worried about the tourists?<br/>
<br/>
The second team's never as good as the first.<br/>
<br/>
Got a look at the directory.<br/>
<br/>
That company moved out three months ago.<br/>
<br/>
If they were ever there at all.<br/>
<br/>
Quiet part of the city here.<br/>
<br/>
Cartel keep Cali buttoned down?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody talks.<br/>
<br/>
All the multinationals used to have offices here in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
""Used to""?<br/>
<br/>
Pulled out because of the city's ties to the narcotics trade.<br/>
<br/>
The Rodríguez brothers are the only game in town now.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking drug dealers pretending to be stockbrokers.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck ruined this city.<br/>
<br/>
Where are we headed next?<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
This way, Mr. Starkman.<br/>
<br/>
How the hell are you supposed to fly international if you can't smoke?<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can always quit.<br/>
<br/>
And let United Airlines tell me how to live?<br/>
<br/>
Remind me again... Kansas City?<br/>
<br/>
- Leavenworth. - What the f*ck for?<br/>
<br/>
My father was in the army. There's a base there.<br/>
<br/>
They sent him to train. I was like... seven years old.<br/>
<br/>
What? It's America.<br/>
<br/>
That's for sure.<br/>
<br/>
So am I meeting the brothers at the hotel?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Serious stones on these guys.<br/>
<br/>
Retiring, like they run Lehman Brothers.<br/>
<br/>
It's a good break for you, though.<br/>
<br/>
You'll get immunity when the surrender goes through.<br/>
<br/>
I don't sell cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
I don't sh**t anyone.<br/>
<br/>
You're a member of the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
You ever hear of conspiracy, amigo?<br/>
<br/>
Relax. I got this. Look, they're lucky to have us both, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
You can't put a price on freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Though Lord knows I try.<br/>
<br/>
I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Currency aside,<br/>
<br/>
we aren't in the habit of paying for things in advance.<br/>
<br/>
What guarantee do we have that you will provide what you promise?<br/>
<br/>
Forgive my brother.<br/>
<br/>
We are grateful for the support you and your people have offered.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, our associate, Mr. Pallomari,<br/>
<br/>
will prepare the contribution and arrange delivery.<br/>
<br/>
Very well.<br/>
<br/>
The contribution should be divided among seven men.<br/>
<br/>
Their names are on the list.<br/>
<br/>
All right, very well. Going forward,<br/>
<br/>
I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari deals with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.<br/>
<br/>
As you wish.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Well, our surrender has been bought. Now it must be paid for.<br/>
<br/>
And they say we're the criminals.<br/>
<br/>
Sons of bitches.<br/>
<br/>
Small price to pay, brother, for the rest of your life.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, I will prepare these payments myself,<br/>
<br/>
as soon as I'm back in the office.<br/>
<br/>
And I'll make sure that all of this is in order.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever make it to Miami and you need a lawyer...<br/>
<br/>
hit me up.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't planning on it, but thank you, Mr. Starkman.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, nobody ever plans on it.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Starkman.<br/>
<br/>
- Welcome to Cali. - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
The Rodríguez brothers are pleased to welcome you.<br/>
<br/>
No offense, but remind me again what you do?<br/>
<br/>
I'm the chief accountant to the Rodríguez brothers.<br/>
<br/>
What happened to the other guy? The good-looking one? Pacho?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Herrera?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I bet he's the guy who's got all the p*ssy in town on speed dial.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Please, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Feistl. - How's it going?<br/>
<br/>
Well, slow so far, but Calderón seems like good police.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Good.<br/>
<br/>
That journalist come through?<br/>
<br/>
I'm on the money man right now.<br/>
<br/>
- See where he takes me. - Gracias.<br/>
<br/>
Eyes open, Feistl.<br/>
<br/>
- Everything by the book. - Will do.<br/>
<br/>
- Keep me posted. - Baby, wait.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
The Arellano Felix brothers<br/>
<br/>
are still wasting time with heroin.<br/>
<br/>
Hey! What? You're not going to say hello?<br/>
<br/>
- Hello. - Are you in a bad mood or what?<br/>
<br/>
Amado... this is the life.<br/>
<br/>
You guys helped me.<br/>
<br/>
I moved the last 100 tons in less than 50 days.<br/>
<br/>
You tell me if we're a great team or not.<br/>
<br/>
That's why we're here.<br/>
<br/>
Can you handle a bigger package?<br/>
<br/>
I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother. What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.<br/>
<br/>
Leader of the Juárez cartel.<br/>
<br/>
He was one of the most enterprising tr*ffick in Mexico<br/>
<br/>
and one of the first to get into business with<br/>
<br/>
his Colombian friends to the south.<br/>
<br/>
While Escobar saw the Mexican tr*ffick as a thr*at,<br/>
<br/>
Cali saw them as a partner.<br/>
<br/>
A partner that shared over 1,900 miles of virtually undefended border.<br/>
<br/>
The United States.<br/>
<br/>
And right about the time the Caribbean corridor closed<br/>
<br/>
along came NAFTA, when the U.S.-Mexico border was open for business.<br/>
<br/>
And Amado took full advantage,<br/>
<br/>
agreeing to ferry Cali cocaine into the States.<br/>
<br/>
They called it ""the Mexican trampoline,""<br/>
<br/>
bouncing cocaine into America, and bouncing cash right back.<br/>
<br/>
I can move however much you give me.<br/>
<br/>
How much?<br/>
<br/>
And for how much longer, Pacho?<br/>
<br/>
Because I know about your deal.<br/>
<br/>
I know you want to turn yourselves in.<br/>
<br/>
There is a deal on the table, Amado.<br/>
<br/>
But we have six months to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, we will honor our commitment to you.<br/>
<br/>
Right, and after?<br/>
<br/>
What happens after that?<br/>
<br/>
The business will adjust.<br/>
<br/>
This I know. It will always adjust. This will never end.<br/>
<br/>
There will be other partners and more drugs. But what about you?<br/>
<br/>
What will happen to you?<br/>
<br/>
You can't tell me you're going to retire,<br/>
<br/>
as if this was any normal business.<br/>
<br/>
You know this is a way of life.<br/>
<br/>
It retires you when it's done with you.<br/>
<br/>
Or are you going to start playing golf like an old man?<br/>
<br/>
We need to count on you maintaining the same terms on this last shipment.<br/>
<br/>
Done.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.<br/>
<br/>
All right? But... you have to come with me to Juárez.<br/>
<br/>
- I want to show you something. - What is it?<br/>
<br/>
The future, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
The f*cking future, that's all.<br/>
<br/>
- Here's your passport. - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
All right, and you board through Gate 15.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
- Have a great trip. - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day.<br/>
<br/>
Next.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to Panama.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to radio ahead to the DEA office.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid not. This plane can't take off. New orders.<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not looking for that kind of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, shit.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck is going on?<br/>
<br/>
Orders are orders. You heard the ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
Our friends from the Senate here want the down-low from a real-life hero.<br/>
<br/>
Guess that's you.<br/>
<br/>
You got somewhere better to be?<br/>
<br/>
You wore the wrong shoes.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the Río n*gro?<br/>
<br/>
What do we got here?<br/>
<br/>
The captain likes this one.<br/>
<br/>
You won't find their name on the lease,<br/>
<br/>
but the Rodríguez brothers own the top six floors.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, f*ck. For real?<br/>
<br/>
I told you, there are some honest cops in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Let me reach out to men I trust.<br/>
<br/>
Quietly. Keep an eye on this place. You go back to Bogotá and...<br/>
<br/>
get a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, guys, the place isn't moving anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Get that paper and we'll turn this place upside down.<br/>
<br/>
Why wait?<br/>
<br/>
Judge in Bogotá signed a warrant for us before we left.<br/>
<br/>
Which you never told me about.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of bullshit I don't like.<br/>
<br/>
Are you playing me or what?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, man, it's like you said. It's hard to know who to trust.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't even sure we were gonna need it.<br/>
<br/>
There's no address on this warrant.<br/>
<br/>
You said this place is connected, so let's put in some work.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know the kind of shit I could land in?<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a DEA pension waiting for me.<br/>
<br/>
Pensions aren't that great, to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Let's do it.<br/>
<br/>
I need a tactical team sent to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?<br/>
<br/>
Copy that. Requesting a tactical team<br/>
<br/>
at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
You do realize, don't you,<br/>
<br/>
after we surrender, all of this shit will end.<br/>
<br/>
No more sitting by the pool, smoking your cigar,<br/>
<br/>
telling everyone what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Miguel, I'm tired of telling people what to do.<br/>
<br/>
And no one has ever listened to you.<br/>
<br/>
What's the difference?<br/>
<br/>
But you know what?<br/>
<br/>
Never, in human history, have two brothers accomplished what we have.<br/>
<br/>
We aren't the first people in history to build an empire, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
But we're the first to retire leaving the empire intact.<br/>
<br/>
If Mom were alive, she'd be proud.<br/>
<br/>
Brothers are well, nephews are well, sons are well.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, we just heard a call<br/>
<br/>
that a tactical team left Jamundí station heading to 4th Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
Enrique, where are you?<br/>
<br/>
Watching our visitors from the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
They've been checking addresses all over town.<br/>
<br/>
But right now, they're stopped, just doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but where are you?<br/>
<br/>
At 15th Street and... 4th. On 4th Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
Enrique, f*ck! There's a police convoy coming at you!<br/>
<br/>
Get Pallomari out of there now!<br/>
<br/>
Answer, you bastard, answer.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello? What's up? - Listen, it's Salcedo.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to have unwelcome guests. Leave now.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time for this. I'm supervising an important project.<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly why I need you to get out.<br/>
<br/>
Just because you say so?<br/>
<br/>
I know you're arranging an important<br/>
<br/>
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, this is none of your business.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet your desk is covered with American dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Guillermo, please.<br/>
<br/>
You've got papers. You've got names.<br/>
<br/>
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.<br/>
<br/>
- Jorge... - Get out of there!<br/>
<br/>
You do your job and I'll do mine.<br/>
<br/>
This is my job! I'm telling you... Son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck your mother.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to check the paper shredders<br/>
<br/>
and the floppy disks still in the computers.<br/>
<br/>
Invoices. Bills of lading. Anything on the computers.<br/>
<br/>
- Warrant says paper only. - Yeah? Warrants say a lot of things.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
At least someone's willing to get wet.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, you'll be back in Intelligence Group soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
It's not...<br/>
<br/>
This is a waste of our time, Chris.<br/>
<br/>
And more importantly, this is a waste of a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
You know what?<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Jackson here says all we find in this f*cking high rise<br/>
<br/>
- is a nice view of the city. - All right.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I got... whoever this guy is and he says otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking shit!<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, how may I help you?<br/>
<br/>
Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.<br/>
<br/>
I'll let them know you're here so you can head up.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh... People love surprises.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, you can't...<br/>
<br/>
You. What the f*ck are you still doing here?<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck am I doing? My job. We told your associate the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, boss, I tried, but he won't listen.<br/>
<br/>
- You go get the car. - Please get out.<br/>
<br/>
- I have to finish. f*ck your mother. - The back stairs.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, sir. - Finish what?<br/>
<br/>
My job, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
No. Please, we have to get rid of all of that now.<br/>
<br/>
We aren't arguing. You aren't touching anything.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a method and a system.<br/>
<br/>
- Method and a system? - Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Yes? What you've got is ten years of jail<br/>
<br/>
time sitting on your desk, you idiot.<br/>
<br/>
- Get out. - No.<br/>
<br/>
Attention! Colombian National Police!<br/>
<br/>
Where are the files?<br/>
<br/>
Get to work. Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
This is an office.<br/>
<br/>
We're working. How can I help you?<br/>
<br/>
We need access to your files, invoices, and all of your correspondence.<br/>
<br/>
Ah...<br/>
<br/>
If that's the case, I need to see a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
Are you supposed to be in charge?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes, I'm in charge.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Good morning. I have to see every invoice you have.<br/>
<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
This says documents only. f*ck your mother.<br/>
<br/>
Could you repeat that, sir? My Spanish is... is a bit rough.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't get that?<br/>
<br/>
- Only papers. - Documents only.<br/>
<br/>
- All right. - Claudia.<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye on the things they're taking. Now!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Leave it. Let it be.<br/>
<br/>
Chivo, check everything and make an inventory, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I like presents. What'd you get us?<br/>
<br/>
That's private.<br/>
<br/>
Ignacio, please show the gentleman last year's documents.<br/>
<br/>
This way, please.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, sir.<br/>
<br/>
I must insist.<br/>
<br/>
Your phone's off the hook.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a bill of lading? Yes? Let me see.<br/>
<br/>
More? Everything.<br/>
<br/>
- Just these? - And copies below.<br/>
<br/>
- These as well, no? - Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- All right. '93. Yeah? - Those are the most recent.<br/>
<br/>
Grab that.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you owe me that 20.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You were right.<br/>
<br/>
This area saw the biggest spike in tr*ffick<br/>
<br/>
after Escobar was k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
Can't we just spray chemicals on this place and be done with it?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, agricultural concerns in the region won't allow it.<br/>
<br/>
That's right. Chiquita Bananas is down here.<br/>
<br/>
I know those guys. Big contributors.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Here we are.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus H. Christ.<br/>
<br/>
Must've been one hell of a firefight, huh?<br/>
<br/>
No doubt, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Gentlemen, this is Captain Mills. - Captain.<br/>
<br/>
- Our advisor on this mission down here. - How you doing, sir?<br/>
<br/>
He liaised with a team of Colombian commandos on this raid here.<br/>
<br/>
These guys FARC or tr*ffick?<br/>
<br/>
Both.<br/>
<br/>
Probably started out doing security for the tr*ffick, or extorting them.<br/>
<br/>
FARC wants to overthrow the government.<br/>
<br/>
Cocaine finances their struggles.<br/>
<br/>
Top of the line.<br/>
<br/>
There's an arms race going on down here.<br/>
<br/>
And this shit...<br/>
<br/>
is jet fuel.<br/>
<br/>
You guys ready for lunch?<br/>
<br/>
Lunch? Yeah. Sure. Why not?<br/>
<br/>
Go. Go. Go.<br/>
<br/>
This 24-hour party thing...<br/>
<br/>
is tiring after a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine if it was your life?<br/>
<br/>
What's on your mind?<br/>
<br/>
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.<br/>
<br/>
What? ""Get the f*ck out""?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
He said... that in this world...<br/>
<br/>
there was no place for a man like me.<br/>
<br/>
I made a place for myself.<br/>
<br/>
I proved him wrong.<br/>
<br/>
And now, I have to give it all up.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of man would I be if I gave it all up?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, brother.<br/>
<br/>
But what I do know is that you have a couple billion dollars...<br/>
<br/>
and the rest of your life to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
What are they giving me?<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, ""What are they giving you?""<br/>
<br/>
They took my son, didn't they?<br/>
<br/>
They have to give us something.<br/>
<br/>
Have they offered you something?<br/>
<br/>
An apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Accept it.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.<br/>
<br/>
We'll take their money now. Later, we'll take vengeance.<br/>
<br/>
- Do it, then get back up here. - Can you wake Pedro up?<br/>
<br/>
I want to speak with him.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
I heard we cut it close today.<br/>
<br/>
I thought they didn't have a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
That's what I was told by our friend on the force.<br/>
<br/>
A few more seconds and we'd have had real trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Those new DEA guys are sharper than they look.<br/>
<br/>
Well, luckily, we have you.<br/>
<br/>
Did they get anything?<br/>
<br/>
Some files.<br/>
<br/>
So nothing. Good.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take care of the rest today.<br/>
<br/>
That thing you've got tonight with Paola, enjoy yourself. Go on.<br/>
<br/>
We got names, addresses. These files are legit.<br/>
<br/>
How are you guys?<br/>
<br/>
Captain.<br/>
<br/>
We'll catalog and seal the ones from today.<br/>
<br/>
If you could help us with transport...<br/>
<br/>
Okay... there must be a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
The files stay here.<br/>
<br/>
We need to sort through these.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, we know how to process evidence, Feistl.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn't the deal. This was our intel.<br/>
<br/>
It was a CNP operation.<br/>
<br/>
We let you join, support.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you f*cking kidding me? - No, I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
But anything we find we'll be sure to share with you.<br/>
<br/>
I was instructed you should be back in Bogotá tonight.<br/>
<br/>
You're going out on the last flight.<br/>
<br/>
He b*rned us.<br/>
<br/>
Who's that, Chris?<br/>
<br/>
The last honest cop in Cali?<br/>
<br/>
No, man. He clowned me, too. I'm calling the boss.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Those things ain't going 25 feet down here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. Hey, you DOD?<br/>
<br/>
So they say. But I still ID as a Marine.<br/>
<br/>
I'm part of the military assistance package.<br/>
<br/>
- CIA? - Oh, shit. f*ck, no.<br/>
<br/>
Can I get a smoke?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Where you from?<br/>
<br/>
The last place? Pendleton.<br/>
<br/>
I was out there teaching Saudi soldiers how to do jumping jacks.<br/>
<br/>
That shit's a lot harder than it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
- So is it really that bad down here? - Yeah. It is.<br/>
<br/>
You got paramilitary, FARC, tr*ffick, us.<br/>
<br/>
Some pretty hairy bullshit down here.<br/>
<br/>
Right, but not hairy enough for the truth to make its case.<br/>
<br/>
Magazines on those bodies are 7.62 millimeter.<br/>
<br/>
They go in an AK-47, right?<br/>
<br/>
Those g*n, the fancy ones, they chamber in a 5.56.<br/>
<br/>
This whole thing is staged.<br/>
<br/>
Those are run-of-the-mill guerrillas. Peasants, not tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
You know your g*n.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna head on down.<br/>
<br/>
Not very original, Stechner.<br/>
<br/>
Even for the CIA.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, sometimes you need to make the truth a little more... plain.<br/>
<br/>
Well, how's this for truth?<br/>
<br/>
They go home and tell everyone the w*r on drugs is a f*cking stage show.<br/>
<br/>
And all the money they put in is pissed away.<br/>
<br/>
Even the hero said it's f*cked up.<br/>
<br/>
What's that do to your plan?<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna level with you.<br/>
<br/>
Sending a five-billion-dollar aid package<br/>
<br/>
to a country that's on the verge of becoming a narco-democracy,<br/>
<br/>
that's a bad look in the Senate.<br/>
<br/>
All due respect, Senator, you're looking at a petri dish for the next Castro,<br/>
<br/>
and this one's fed by narco dollars.<br/>
<br/>
And not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.<br/>
<br/>
Rich dictators with anti-American hard-ons.<br/>
<br/>
We turn our back on this place, it all goes to hell.<br/>
<br/>
Colombia is perfectly situated to help us in both Central and South America.<br/>
<br/>
The right American footprint here, Black Hawks, small arms,<br/>
<br/>
night vision, advisors like Mills...<br/>
<br/>
we help secure a s*ab Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
and it becomes a beacon for the region.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you want the American people<br/>
<br/>
to get behind sending billions of dollars to Colombia...<br/>
<br/>
we need a no-f*cking-around victory down here.<br/>
<br/>
Look, gentlemen, the Colombian government<br/>
<br/>
is months away from dismantling one of the biggest drug cartels in history.<br/>
<br/>
And they will do it without f*ring a sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
No body count, no dirty hands.<br/>
<br/>
I can't imagine the folks back home won't like that.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Peña.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Is it true? Is a big win coming?<br/>
<br/>
Agent Stechner and I...<br/>
<br/>
we have a long-standing difference of opinion on just about everything.<br/>
<br/>
But he and I can both agree...<br/>
<br/>
a big win is coming.<br/>
<br/>
Glad we're on the same page, Agent Peña.<br/>
<br/>
So the whole surrender plan is about f*cking fundraising!<br/>
<br/>
The Colombians get a check and you get to play army men in the jungle?<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking about the next battle, the one that really counts.<br/>
<br/>
Which means you're willing to lose this one!<br/>
<br/>
The drug w*r?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, come on, man! We lost it!<br/>
<br/>
You were there!<br/>
<br/>
Ever stop and think that anyone that takes this as personally as you do<br/>
<br/>
is doing it wrong?<br/>
<br/>
- f*ck you! - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
See ya!<br/>
<br/>
Where are they now?<br/>
<br/>
I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
- And the files? - We've got them.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
Look, they tricked me with that f*cking warrant, all right?<br/>
<br/>
And I couldn't warn you because we were all together like a f*cking family.<br/>
<br/>
These Americans know what they're doing.<br/>
<br/>
They aren't f*cking idiots.<br/>
<br/>
I ever tell you I did a rotation in Chile?<br/>
<br/>
No, Dan, you never told me you did a rotation in f*cking Chile.<br/>
<br/>
The accountant.<br/>
<br/>
- You clock his accent? - No.<br/>
<br/>
A little off. You know, he said something: ""Concha su madre.""<br/>
<br/>
Okay, what's that? ""f*ck your mother"" or something?<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
""Cachai.""<br/>
<br/>
It's a phrase that they typically only use in Chile.<br/>
<br/>
And if he's from Chile...<br/>
<br/>
He can be extradited.<br/>
<br/>
Panama DEA said no warrant, no detention.<br/>
<br/>
- f*ck. - Plus, Jurado didn't stay in Panama.<br/>
<br/>
They know where he went?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
So Jurado could be anywhere. f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Also, boss, Feistl and Van Ness have been trying you. A lot.<br/>
<br/>
All right, well, put them through when you get them. I'm on my way back.<br/>
<br/>
- And Stoddard? - Yeah, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Jurado has a wife in Bogotá. She's American.<br/>
<br/>
Put a tap on her phone.<br/>
<br/>
- I don't think I can do that. - Just do it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the truth is, we're very interested in your proposal, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
And in your potential for growth.<br/>
<br/>
You've exceeded Paola's description,<br/>
<br/>
which wasn't easy.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we were inconvenienced by the six-month delay, which...<br/>
<br/>
took us by surprise.<br/>
<br/>
I take my commitments very seriously, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
And I couldn't leave without ensuring my replacement met the standard<br/>
<br/>
they've come to expect.<br/>
<br/>
Go wait for him over there.<br/>
<br/>
- Good evening. How are you? - Good, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think that merits another bottle of wine, no?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Look at that son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
So, a security expert married to a rising star<br/>
<br/>
in one of Cali's top law firms.<br/>
<br/>
Have you worked together before?<br/>
<br/>
My compliments.<br/>
<br/>
David Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
How are you?<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.<br/>
<br/>
This guy's a real son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he's one of our best men.<br/>
<br/>
You see?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
You... Where do you know him from? Is he a friend of yours?<br/>
<br/>
You know Cali is a very small city.<br/>
<br/>
Even more so when one is in the security business.<br/>
<br/>
One must deal with all sorts of people.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the paperwork I'm supposed to deliver?<br/>
<br/>
These documents are very sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't feel comfortable transferring possession to anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Let's go, then.<br/>
<br/>
Open the door, Córdova.<br/>
<br/>
Go f*ck yourself, Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
- Huh? - In the front seat.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck's wrong with you? Open the door. f*ck your mother.<br/>
<br/>
In the front. I'm not your f*cking employee.<br/>
<br/>
Making friends everywhere he goes.<br/>
<br/>
No shit.<br/>
<br/>
Look at this f*cking neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
This guy's doing more than filing W-9s.<br/>
<br/>
Es el cabrón.<br/>
<br/>
The f*cking man.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to reach an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
He's very stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me, Pacho. We have to seal the deal.<br/>
<br/>
It's very important.<br/>
<br/>
Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow. I'll go with him and close the deal.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Keep me informed.<br/>
<br/>
Good night.<br/>
<br/>
Good night, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Compliments of Mr. Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long time since anyone asked me on a date.<br/>
<br/>
Come in, please.<br/>
<br/>
Take a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Sir... your offer of this apartment is very generous.<br/>
<br/>
But?<br/>
<br/>
But... I would like to know the terms.<br/>
<br/>
The terms?<br/>
<br/>
How often will you come here to visit me?<br/>
<br/>
As often as you like.<br/>
<br/>
Or never.<br/>
<br/>
This is your home.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a monthly stipend?<br/>
<br/>
A stipend?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Rodríguez, I married Claudio Salazar when I was 18 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I knew nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to get away from his family, and I need my son back.<br/>
<br/>
If you could help me with that...<br/>
<br/>
I can.<br/>
<br/>
Then I accept.<br/>
<br/>
It's great to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you get some rest?<br/>
<br/>
Eat something.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning, I'll send for your son.<br/>
<br/>
How does that sound?<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
Take a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Fifty miles an hour, you could jump into water and survive.<br/>
<br/>
You can't leave her on the bus.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you do. You leave her on the bus.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
- I would leave her. - You would leave her?<br/>
<br/>
Shh...<br/>
<br/>
All right. Here we go.<br/>
<br/>
Dan.<br/>
<br/>
Is that who I think it is?<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto f*cking Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my f*cking God. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
- Peña. - Boss, it's Feistl.<br/>
<br/>
- Where the f*ck have you been? - Sir, I got eyes on Gilberto Rodríguez.<br/>
<br/>
- You're looking at him right now? - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Just say the word and we can take him down.<br/>
<br/>
What's the move, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
You want to go after Gilberto Rodríguez?</div>]","Amado Carrillo Fuentes!

The Lord of the Skies!

How f*cking elegant, f*ck.

- Don't tease. - God damn, f*ck.

- Your little brother? - Yes. Alvaro.

Come here, son.

- You also get a hug. - Sir.

How are you doing?

320 million kinds of okay.

Doesn't it smell like the f*cking U.S. Treasury in here?

- This half is yours. - Yes?

Don't forget it.

All right. We came at a good time, then.

A Tuesday like any other, Pacho. You know how it is.

f*ck.

- Let's go to the house. - Let's go.

All right. Son, do you like margaritas?

Of course I do.

Great, because I have a Margarita for you.

She'll suck you dry.

Welcome to Mexico, f*ck.

Let's go.

Take the money and destroy the plane.

First off, Senator Martin and I would like to thank you

for having us down, Ambassador.

But, you gotta know what's going on in Washington.

Folks are wondering if we're gonna win this thing.

And as senior members of the Appropriations Committee,

those questions are directed at us.

Now, everyone's proud of the work you guys did to bring down Escobar.

And it's particularly an honor to meet you, Agent Peña.

But cocaine continues to flow north, and the American people wonder

if the Colombians share our enthusiasm to take this thr*at head-on.

Our colleague, Senator Helms, put forward some tough language on them.

But we wanted to come down here and get the real from you all.

See firsthand what's at stake.

See how and... if we can give you all the support you need.

Let's extend the senators every courtesy while they're here.

Their mission is a priority.

They ask... you answer.

Thank you.

Money makes the world go 'round.

Legal or illegal, good guys and bad guys, we all chase money.

For the DEA, it's about budget meetings and kissing the right ass

to keep the funding flowing.

But if you're a tr*ffick, getting the money is easy.

It's holding onto it that's hard.

In the early days, cash was flown back to Colombia

on the same planes that carried coke into the States.

Then it was converted into pesos, or, if you were Pablo Escobar,

stuck in a hole somewhere.

One tr*ffick died with so much cash buried on his property, when it rained,

the river downstream became clogged with bills that had washed free.

The biggest problem with illegal money is the trail that it leaves.

Once upon a time, American banks would take your money, no questions asked.

That changed when President Nixon signed the Bank Secrecy Act,

requiring all U.S. banks to report transactions

involving more than $10,000 in cash.

And from that law, money laundering was born.

The first stage of money laundering is called placement,

and Cali had it down to an art.

Bringing workers from the comunas to the U.S.,

where their job was to buy money orders,

each just under ten grand, so they wouldn't be reported.

No I.D. was required.

And the orders could even remain blank until they were deposited or cashed.

Once they bought a bunch of money orders,

they packed them up and sent them south

to a land of sunshine and lax oversight.

Panama.

Since they didn't regulate wire transfers, Panama was the perfect place

for the second stage of money laundering: Layering.

And here's where the master goes to work.

The behind the scenes MVP of any drug cartel is the money launderer,

the guy that takes the dirty money and scrubs it clean. Here's how:

The money orders were deposited into local bank accounts,

and then bounced through shell companies and limited partnerships,

creating an untraceable web of phony purchase orders and transaction reports,

wiping clean the money's criminal origins.

But no matter how well you hide it, money always leaves a trail.

And the best way to hurt the Cali cartel was to find it.

Cali. Muy hermosa, right?

f*ck you, Chris.

The man asked me if I had a partner, and your desk is across from mine.

You really f*cked me, man.

You gonna ride a desk all the way to Special Operations Unit?

Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

Agents Feistl, Van Ness...?

- Feistl. - Welcome to Cali.

- Gracias. - Captain Calderón.

We're happy to be here.

And what brings you to Cali?

We've got some addresses we want to investigate.

Cartel-related?

Not necessarily.

What a surprise. DEA agents that don't trust us.

How did that work out for the last two guys?

Friend, in Cali, there are more corrupt cops than there are churches.

You don't trust me? I understand.

But if you want to get anything done in Cali, you need the police's help.

If not me, someone else.

Not my rule.

- I understand. - Good.

The addresses are linked to cartel financial operations.

We want to put eyes on them. See if any of the dots start connecting...

You've come a long way to connect dots.

We work with what we've got.

Unless you can tell me where I can find Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez.

If they didn't own half of the city, I couldn't even be sure they exist.

The Rodríguez brothers are ghosts.

It was true.

While the terms of surrender were being finalized,

the brothers had gone underground to avoid capture.

They abandoned their swank estates, secretly moving to new homes,

where they could continue running their empire

without setting foot in one of their legitimate businesses.

And all this while Chepe continued to expand their New York operation.

But sometimes, even the best get unlucky.

A computer glitch in Monaco led authorities to notice

that one limited partnership had multiple accounts at the same bank.

When they looked closer,

they found it had ties to hundreds of bullshit accounts across Europe.

And they all led back to one bank...

right here in Bogotá.

Lucky for us, the president had given the DEA our best w*apon yet:

The Clinton list.

If we suspected a company of working with tr*ffick,

their name went on the list.

And then they were banned from doing business with U.S. companies

and U.S. companies were banned from doing business with them.

You get f*cked both ways.

And you want to know what the best part is?

We don't even have to prove it.

We just... put you on the list.

And the OFAC takes care of the rest.

How can I help you, Agent Peña?

Armed with the thr*at of the Clinton list,

we could get pretty much any information we wanted,

and that's how we were able to give.

Cali's number one money launderer a name:

Franklin Jurado.

Because it was illegal for Colombian citizens

to have U.S. currency in their possession,

a money launderer became more than just a connection

to the financial institutions that washed their cash.

For all intents and purposes, he is their money.

Jurado was the perfect bridge between the narcos

and the world of high finance.

He spoke five languages and traveled on multiple passports.

He married an American girl he met while at business school in the States,

took her down south, and got her in on his action.

That American passport was solid gold in any Caribbean bank.

Jurado was smooth. But now, we knew his name.

These are cash transfers.

The accounts are controlled by a man named Franklin Jurado.

- You know him? - Of him.

He served as director at Interamericas.

- The Rodríguez brothers' bank. - Mm-hmm.

They later gave him a more important job.

Do you have an address for Jurado?

I can get it for you.

So what happened since the last time I saw you?

Are you going to take these men on, or what?

- I'm going to do my job. - And your bosses?

Do they know what you're doing?

No comment.

I was thinking...

maybe I could come with you.

Oh, come on, this could be our last chance to travel like we used to.

- Remember that place in Milan? - With the leaking roof?

On your birthday. And that terrible risotto.

That balcony.

The brothers are pushing now, baby. They are opening more accounts.

- It's dangerous. - I don't care.

How high are you right now?

Hey, f*ck you!

Give me your passport.

I can't stay in this apartment anymore, Franklin.

I can't watch another movie with subtitles by myself.

I don't want to listen to the cartel wives talk about their husbands...

- With an English degree from Harvard... - Please don't tell me I can teach.

Then what did you want me to say?

f*ck.

We'll do this another time.

The dining room is over here.

You have a room over here.

You have another one over here.

And here, you have the living room.

The dimmer is over here.

And you can adjust the light.

Well... you get the idea.

- No. I don't understand. - What don't you understand?

Does this seem normal to you?

You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez

you were uncertain about returning to the North Valley.

And that's why he bought me a palace. With dimmers.

Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

but I need to think about his generous offer.

We have that dinner tonight.

With your friends?

With the investors.

They're not going to like the six-month delay.

And I think it's best if we don't mention the Rodríguez brothers by name.

I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

I know you did it for your family.

But if these people like everything they hear tonight,

you'll have your own security firm the second these six months are up.

- Ready! - Good!

A choir!

All right, say bye to Dad. We're leaving.

- Bye. - Bye.

All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

Will you make it on time?

If you're wearing the dress with the flowers, yes.

Let's go, girls.

Today is a busy day for us, boys.

Bosses have meetings all day at the National Hotel.

I need you to pre-sweep each and every location on this schedule.

And I don't want a bunch of cars parked like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

He's looking at you, Montez.

Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

Don Miguel's team on channel six. Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.

Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.

They're working with the National Police.

But they don't have warrants. They're tourists.

They need permission to wipe their own asses.

Regardless, while they're in Cali, we'll be watching them.

- That's your job, Enrique, my brother. - Yes, sir.

That's all, gentlemen.

Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

I have to duck out early. It's a work thing for Paola.

Of course.

Do you want to practice your English?

Starkman, the American lawyer, arrives today.

Can you pick him up from the airport?

Aren't you worried about the tourists?

The second team's never as good as the first.

Got a look at the directory.

That company moved out three months ago.

If they were ever there at all.

Quiet part of the city here.

Cartel keep Cali buttoned down?

Nobody talks.

All the multinationals used to have offices here in Cali.

""Used to""?

Pulled out because of the city's ties to the narcotics trade.

The Rodríguez brothers are the only game in town now.

f*cking drug dealers pretending to be stockbrokers.

f*ck ruined this city.

Where are we headed next?

Please.

This way, Mr. Starkman.

How the hell are you supposed to fly international if you can't smoke?

I guess you can always quit.

And let United Airlines tell me how to live?

Remind me again... Kansas City?

- Leavenworth. - What the f*ck for?

My father was in the army. There's a base there.

They sent him to train. I was like... seven years old.

What? It's America.

That's for sure.

So am I meeting the brothers at the hotel?

Yes.

Serious stones on these guys.

Retiring, like they run Lehman Brothers.

It's a good break for you, though.

You'll get immunity when the surrender goes through.

I don't sell cocaine.

I don't sh**t anyone.

You're a member of the Cali cartel.

You ever hear of conspiracy, amigo?

Relax. I got this. Look, they're lucky to have us both, Jorge.

You can't put a price on freedom.

Though Lord knows I try.

I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?

Of course.

Currency aside,

we aren't in the habit of paying for things in advance.

What guarantee do we have that you will provide what you promise?

Forgive my brother.

We are grateful for the support you and your people have offered.

This afternoon, our associate, Mr. Pallomari,

will prepare the contribution and arrange delivery.

Very well.

The contribution should be divided among seven men.

Their names are on the list.

All right, very well. Going forward,

I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari deals with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.

As you wish.

Have a great day, gentlemen.

Well, our surrender has been bought. Now it must be paid for.

And they say we're the criminals.

Sons of bitches.

Small price to pay, brother, for the rest of your life.

Gentlemen, I will prepare these payments myself,

as soon as I'm back in the office.

And I'll make sure that all of this is in order.

Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.

If you ever make it to Miami and you need a lawyer...

hit me up.

I wasn't planning on it, but thank you, Mr. Starkman.

Yeah, nobody ever plans on it.

Mr. Starkman.

- Welcome to Cali. - Yeah.

The Rodríguez brothers are pleased to welcome you.

No offense, but remind me again what you do?

I'm the chief accountant to the Rodríguez brothers.

What happened to the other guy? The good-looking one? Pacho?

Mr. Herrera?

Yeah, I bet he's the guy who's got all the p*ssy in town on speed dial.

Yeah. Please, sir.

- Feistl. - How's it going?

Well, slow so far, but Calderón seems like good police.

Yeah. Good.

That journalist come through?

I'm on the money man right now.

- See where he takes me. - Gracias.

Eyes open, Feistl.

- Everything by the book. - Will do.

- Keep me posted. - Baby, wait.

I'm sorry.

Come here.

The Arellano Felix brothers

are still wasting time with heroin.

Hey! What? You're not going to say hello?

- Hello. - Are you in a bad mood or what?

Amado... this is the life.

You guys helped me.

I moved the last 100 tons in less than 50 days.

You tell me if we're a great team or not.

That's why we're here.

Can you handle a bigger package?

I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother. What do you think?

Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

Leader of the Juárez cartel.

He was one of the most enterprising tr*ffick in Mexico

and one of the first to get into business with

his Colombian friends to the south.

While Escobar saw the Mexican tr*ffick as a thr*at,

Cali saw them as a partner.

A partner that shared over 1,900 miles of virtually undefended border.

The United States.

And right about the time the Caribbean corridor closed

along came NAFTA, when the U.S.-Mexico border was open for business.

And Amado took full advantage,

agreeing to ferry Cali cocaine into the States.

They called it ""the Mexican trampoline,""

bouncing cocaine into America, and bouncing cash right back.

I can move however much you give me.

How much?

And for how much longer, Pacho?

Because I know about your deal.

I know you want to turn yourselves in.

There is a deal on the table, Amado.

But we have six months to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.

Until then, we will honor our commitment to you.

Right, and after?

What happens after that?

The business will adjust.

This I know. It will always adjust. This will never end.

There will be other partners and more drugs. But what about you?

What will happen to you?

You can't tell me you're going to retire,

as if this was any normal business.

You know this is a way of life.

It retires you when it's done with you.

Or are you going to start playing golf like an old man?

We need to count on you maintaining the same terms on this last shipment.

Done.

It'll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.

All right? But... you have to come with me to Juárez.

- I want to show you something. - What is it?

The future, Pacho.

The f*cking future, that's all.

- Here's your passport. - Thank you.

All right, and you board through Gate 15.

Okay.

- Have a great trip. - Thank you.

Have a great day.

Next.

I'm going to Panama.

I need you to radio ahead to the DEA office.

I'm afraid not. This plane can't take off. New orders.

What are you talking about?

I'm sorry, sir. I'm not looking for that kind of trouble.

Oh, shit.

What the f*ck is going on?

Orders are orders. You heard the ambassador.

Our friends from the Senate here want the down-low from a real-life hero.

Guess that's you.

You got somewhere better to be?

You wore the wrong shoes.

f*ck.

Is that the Río n*gro?

What do we got here?

The captain likes this one.

You won't find their name on the lease,

but the Rodríguez brothers own the top six floors.

Oh, f*ck. For real?

I told you, there are some honest cops in Cali.

Let me reach out to men I trust.

Quietly. Keep an eye on this place. You go back to Bogotá and...

get a warrant.

Come on, guys, the place isn't moving anywhere.

Get that paper and we'll turn this place upside down.

Why wait?

Judge in Bogotá signed a warrant for us before we left.

Which you never told me about.

This is the kind of bullshit I don't like.

Are you playing me or what?

Hey, man, it's like you said. It's hard to know who to trust.

I wasn't even sure we were gonna need it.

There's no address on this warrant.

You said this place is connected, so let's put in some work.

Do you know the kind of shit I could land in?

Huh?

I don't have a DEA pension waiting for me.

Pensions aren't that great, to be honest.

f*ck.

Let's do it.

I need a tactical team sent to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?

Copy that. Requesting a tactical team

at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.

You do realize, don't you,

after we surrender, all of this shit will end.

No more sitting by the pool, smoking your cigar,

telling everyone what to do.

Look, Miguel, I'm tired of telling people what to do.

And no one has ever listened to you.

What's the difference?

But you know what?

Never, in human history, have two brothers accomplished what we have.

We aren't the first people in history to build an empire, Gilberto.

But we're the first to retire leaving the empire intact.

If Mom were alive, she'd be proud.

Brothers are well, nephews are well, sons are well.

Boss, we just heard a call

that a tactical team left Jamundí station heading to 4th Avenue.

Enrique, where are you?

Watching our visitors from the DEA.

They've been checking addresses all over town.

But right now, they're stopped, just doing nothing.

Yes, but where are you?

At 15th Street and... 4th. On 4th Avenue.

Enrique, f*ck! There's a police convoy coming at you!

Get Pallomari out of there now!

Answer, you bastard, answer.

- Hello? What's up? - Listen, it's Salcedo.

You're going to have unwelcome guests. Leave now.

I don't have time for this. I'm supervising an important project.

That's exactly why I need you to get out.

Just because you say so?

I know you're arranging an important

transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

Listen, this is none of your business.

I'll bet your desk is covered with American dollars.

Look, Guillermo, please.

You've got papers. You've got names.

You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

- Jorge... - Get out of there!

You do your job and I'll do mine.

This is my job! I'm telling you... Son of a bitch!

f*ck your mother.

I need you to check the paper shredders

and the floppy disks still in the computers.

Invoices. Bills of lading. Anything on the computers.

- Warrant says paper only. - Yeah? Warrants say a lot of things.

Let's go.

At least someone's willing to get wet.

Don't worry, you'll be back in Intelligence Group soon enough.

It's not...

This is a waste of our time, Chris.

And more importantly, this is a waste of a warrant.

You know what?

Andrew Jackson here says all we find in this f*cking high rise

- is a nice view of the city. - All right.

Well, I got... whoever this guy is and he says otherwise.

f*cking shit!

Gentlemen, how may I help you?

Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.

I'll let them know you're here so you can head up.

Oh, oh, oh... People love surprises.

Gentlemen, you can't...

You. What the f*ck are you still doing here?

What the f*ck am I doing? My job. We told your associate the same thing.

Sorry, boss, I tried, but he won't listen.

- You go get the car. - Please get out.

- I have to finish. f*ck your mother. - The back stairs.

- Yes, sir. - Finish what?

My job, Jorge.

No. Please, we have to get rid of all of that now.

We aren't arguing. You aren't touching anything.

I've got a method and a system.

- Method and a system? - Yes, sir.

Yes? What you've got is ten years of jail

time sitting on your desk, you idiot.

- Get out. - No.

Attention! Colombian National Police!

Where are the files?

Get to work. Let's go!

This is an office.

We're working. How can I help you?

We need access to your files, invoices, and all of your correspondence.

Ah...

If that's the case, I need to see a warrant.

Are you supposed to be in charge?

Well, yes, I'm in charge.

Come on.

Good morning. I have to see every invoice you have.

Hey!

This says documents only. f*ck your mother.

Could you repeat that, sir? My Spanish is... is a bit rough.

You didn't get that?

- Only papers. - Documents only.

- All right. - Claudia.

Keep an eye on the things they're taking. Now!

Yes, sir.

Leave it. Let it be.

Chivo, check everything and make an inventory, all right?

Hey, I like presents. What'd you get us?

That's private.

Ignacio, please show the gentleman last year's documents.

This way, please.

Excuse me, sir.

I must insist.

Your phone's off the hook.

Do you have a bill of lading? Yes? Let me see.

More? Everything.

- Just these? - And copies below.

- These as well, no? - Yes, sir.

- All right. '93. Yeah? - Those are the most recent.

Grab that.

Looks like you owe me that 20.

Oh, yeah.

You were right.

This area saw the biggest spike in tr*ffick

after Escobar was k*ll.

Can't we just spray chemicals on this place and be done with it?

Unfortunately, agricultural concerns in the region won't allow it.

That's right. Chiquita Bananas is down here.

I know those guys. Big contributors.

Okay. Here we are.

Jesus H. Christ.

Must've been one hell of a firefight, huh?

No doubt, sir.

- Gentlemen, this is Captain Mills. - Captain.

- Our advisor on this mission down here. - How you doing, sir?

He liaised with a team of Colombian commandos on this raid here.

These guys FARC or tr*ffick?

Both.

Probably started out doing security for the tr*ffick, or extorting them.

FARC wants to overthrow the government.

Cocaine finances their struggles.

Top of the line.

There's an arms race going on down here.

And this shit...

is jet fuel.

You guys ready for lunch?

Lunch? Yeah. Sure. Why not?

Go. Go. Go.

This 24-hour party thing...

is tiring after a couple of days.

Can you imagine if it was your life?

What's on your mind?

Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

What? ""Get the f*ck out""?

No.

He said... that in this world...

there was no place for a man like me.

I made a place for myself.

I proved him wrong.

And now, I have to give it all up.

What kind of man would I be if I gave it all up?

I don't know, brother.

But what I do know is that you have a couple billion dollars...

and the rest of your life to figure it out.

What are they giving me?

What do you mean, ""What are they giving you?""

They took my son, didn't they?

They have to give us something.

Have they offered you something?

An apartment.

Accept it.

Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.

We'll take their money now. Later, we'll take vengeance.

- Do it, then get back up here. - Can you wake Pedro up?

I want to speak with him.

Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.

I heard we cut it close today.

I thought they didn't have a warrant.

That's what I was told by our friend on the force.

A few more seconds and we'd have had real trouble.

Those new DEA guys are sharper than they look.

Well, luckily, we have you.

Did they get anything?

Some files.

So nothing. Good.

I'll take care of the rest today.

That thing you've got tonight with Paola, enjoy yourself. Go on.

We got names, addresses. These files are legit.

How are you guys?

Captain.

We'll catalog and seal the ones from today.

If you could help us with transport...

Okay... there must be a misunderstanding.

The files stay here.

We need to sort through these.

As you can see, we know how to process evidence, Feistl.

That wasn't the deal. This was our intel.

It was a CNP operation.

We let you join, support.

- Are you f*cking kidding me? - No, I'm not.

I'm not.

But anything we find we'll be sure to share with you.

I was instructed you should be back in Bogotá tonight.

You're going out on the last flight.

He b*rned us.

Who's that, Chris?

The last honest cop in Cali?

No, man. He clowned me, too. I'm calling the boss.

f*ck!

Those things ain't going 25 feet down here.

Thanks. Hey, you DOD?

So they say. But I still ID as a Marine.

I'm part of the military assistance package.

- CIA? - Oh, shit. f*ck, no.

Can I get a smoke?

Thanks.

Where you from?

The last place? Pendleton.

I was out there teaching Saudi soldiers how to do jumping jacks.

That shit's a lot harder than it sounds.

- So is it really that bad down here? - Yeah. It is.

You got paramilitary, FARC, tr*ffick, us.

Some pretty hairy bullshit down here.

Right, but not hairy enough for the truth to make its case.

Magazines on those bodies are 7.62 millimeter.

They go in an AK-47, right?

Those g*n, the fancy ones, they chamber in a 5.56.

This whole thing is staged.

Those are run-of-the-mill guerrillas. Peasants, not tr*ffick.

You know your g*n.

I'm gonna head on down.

Not very original, Stechner.

Even for the CIA.

Yeah, well, sometimes you need to make the truth a little more... plain.

Well, how's this for truth?

They go home and tell everyone the w*r on drugs is a f*cking stage show.

And all the money they put in is pissed away.

Even the hero said it's f*cked up.

What's that do to your plan?

I'm gonna level with you.

Sending a five-billion-dollar aid package

to a country that's on the verge of becoming a narco-democracy,

that's a bad look in the Senate.

All due respect, Senator, you're looking at a petri dish for the next Castro,

and this one's fed by narco dollars.

And not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.

Rich dictators with anti-American hard-ons.

We turn our back on this place, it all goes to hell.

Colombia is perfectly situated to help us in both Central and South America.

The right American footprint here, Black Hawks, small arms,

night vision, advisors like Mills...

we help secure a s*ab Colombia,

and it becomes a beacon for the region.

Well, if you want the American people

to get behind sending billions of dollars to Colombia...

we need a no-f*cking-around victory down here.

Look, gentlemen, the Colombian government

is months away from dismantling one of the biggest drug cartels in history.

And they will do it without f*ring a sh*t.

No body count, no dirty hands.

I can't imagine the folks back home won't like that.

Agent Peña.

What do you think?

Is it true? Is a big win coming?

Agent Stechner and I...

we have a long-standing difference of opinion on just about everything.

But he and I can both agree...

a big win is coming.

Glad we're on the same page, Agent Peña.

So the whole surrender plan is about f*cking fundraising!

The Colombians get a check and you get to play army men in the jungle?

I'm thinking about the next battle, the one that really counts.

Which means you're willing to lose this one!

The drug w*r?

Oh, come on, man! We lost it!

You were there!

Ever stop and think that anyone that takes this as personally as you do

is doing it wrong?

- f*ck you! - Yeah.

See ya!

Where are they now?

I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.

- And the files? - We've got them.

Are you sure?

Look, they tricked me with that f*cking warrant, all right?

And I couldn't warn you because we were all together like a f*cking family.

These Americans know what they're doing.

They aren't f*cking idiots.

I ever tell you I did a rotation in Chile?

No, Dan, you never told me you did a rotation in f*cking Chile.

The accountant.

- You clock his accent? - No.

A little off. You know, he said something: ""Concha su madre.""

Okay, what's that? ""f*ck your mother"" or something?

Exactly.

""Cachai.""

It's a phrase that they typically only use in Chile.

And if he's from Chile...

He can be extradited.

Panama DEA said no warrant, no detention.

- f*ck. - Plus, Jurado didn't stay in Panama.

They know where he went?

No.

So Jurado could be anywhere. f*ck!

Also, boss, Feistl and Van Ness have been trying you. A lot.

All right, well, put them through when you get them. I'm on my way back.

- And Stoddard? - Yeah, boss?

Jurado has a wife in Bogotá. She's American.

Put a tap on her phone.

- I don't think I can do that. - Just do it.

Well, the truth is, we're very interested in your proposal, Jorge.

And in your potential for growth.

You've exceeded Paola's description,

which wasn't easy.

Of course, we were inconvenienced by the six-month delay, which...

took us by surprise.

I take my commitments very seriously, gentlemen.

And I couldn't leave without ensuring my replacement met the standard

they've come to expect.

Go wait for him over there.

- Good evening. How are you? - Good, thank you.

Well, I think that merits another bottle of wine, no?

Yes.

Look at that son of a bitch.

Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?

Thank you.

So, a security expert married to a rising star

in one of Cali's top law firms.

Have you worked together before?

My compliments.

David Rodríguez.

How are you?

Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

This guy's a real son of a bitch.

Seriously.

In fact, he's one of our best men.

You see?

Enjoy it.

Ma'am.

You... Where do you know him from? Is he a friend of yours?

You know Cali is a very small city.

Even more so when one is in the security business.

One must deal with all sorts of people.

Is that the paperwork I'm supposed to deliver?

These documents are very sensitive.

And I don't feel comfortable transferring possession to anyone else.

All right. Let's go, then.

Open the door, Córdova.

Go f*ck yourself, Pallomari.

- Huh? - In the front seat.

What the f*ck's wrong with you? Open the door. f*ck your mother.

In the front. I'm not your f*cking employee.

Making friends everywhere he goes.

No shit.

Look at this f*cking neighborhood.

This guy's doing more than filing W-9s.

Es el cabrón.

The f*cking man.

I haven't been able to reach an agreement.

He's very stubborn.

Listen to me, Pacho. We have to seal the deal.

It's very important.

Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow. I'll go with him and close the deal.

All right. Keep me informed.

Good night.

Good night, Gilberto.

Compliments of Mr. Carrillo.

It's been a long time since anyone asked me on a date.

Come in, please.

Take a seat.

Sir... your offer of this apartment is very generous.

But?

But... I would like to know the terms.

The terms?

How often will you come here to visit me?

As often as you like.

Or never.

This is your home.

Is there a monthly stipend?

A stipend?

Mr. Rodríguez, I married Claudio Salazar when I was 18 years old.

I knew nothing.

Now I need to get away from his family, and I need my son back.

If you could help me with that...

I can.

Then I accept.

It's great to hear that.

Why don't you get some rest?

Eat something.

Tomorrow morning, I'll send for your son.

How does that sound?

Good.

Take a seat.

Fifty miles an hour, you could jump into water and survive.

You can't leave her on the bus.

I guess you do. You leave her on the bus.

No.

- I would leave her. - You would leave her?

Shh...

All right. Here we go.

Dan.

Is that who I think it is?

Gilberto f*cking Rodríguez.

f*ck.

Oh, my f*cking God. Okay.

- Peña. - Boss, it's Feistl.

- Where the f*ck have you been? - Sir, I got eyes on Gilberto Rodríguez.

- You're looking at him right now? - Yes.

Just say the word and we can take him down.

What's the move, boss?

Sorry to interrupt.

You want to go after Gilberto Rodríguez?"
03x02 - The Cali KGB,"[<div class=""content"">Careful. You already lost one.<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
-Faster, gentlemen, please.<br/>
<br/>
-Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
How's it coming?<br/>
<br/>
This is f*cking cool.<br/>
<br/>
What did I tell you, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
Stop f*cking around.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to be here all night.<br/>
<br/>
Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's all good.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking idiot.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had 20 years in this shit.<br/>
<br/>
I only have six months.<br/>
<br/>
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.<br/>
<br/>
How many of these things<br/>
<br/>
do we have to empty?<br/>
<br/>
How much f*cking money<br/>
<br/>
do you want to make?<br/>
<br/>
A f*cking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Salazar?<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.<br/>
<br/>
-Come back later, please.<br/>
<br/>
-As you wish.<br/>
<br/>
If you want something done right...<br/>
<br/>
you have to do it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't play,<br/>
<br/>
you're going to watch others score.<br/>
<br/>
My organization has four partners,<br/>
<br/>
but only one leader.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to meet with you<br/>
<br/>
to make sure there are<br/>
<br/>
no misunderstandings in the North Valley<br/>
<br/>
regarding the restructuring,<br/>
<br/>
and the necessary house cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
No, we were simply curious<br/>
<br/>
about Claudio Salazar's absence.<br/>
<br/>
I will be honest with you.<br/>
<br/>
Salazar never contributed a thing.<br/>
<br/>
He never gave anyone work.<br/>
<br/>
He made more noise than money.<br/>
<br/>
Better said, too much noise.<br/>
<br/>
We are moving forward with the plan,<br/>
<br/>
and we would like to know<br/>
<br/>
if our friends are in agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Your message about the surrender<br/>
<br/>
was very clear,<br/>
<br/>
and was very well received<br/>
<br/>
by all of us in the North Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Have a safe trip home.<br/>
<br/>
Henao... thank you for your friendship.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take advantage of this window<br/>
<br/>
to maximize our profits.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to double our output<br/>
<br/>
through Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you go there?<br/>
<br/>
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.<br/>
<br/>
Make one last deal.<br/>
<br/>
We both know that isn't the only reason<br/>
<br/>
you're sending me there.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Pacho...<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be best<br/>
<br/>
if you left Cali for a bit...<br/>
<br/>
while things cool off.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, Pacho, we're going<br/>
<br/>
to walk away from this happy and rich.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT IS THE DEA DOING IN CALI?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you have liked<br/>
<br/>
to be born in this era?<br/>
<br/>
Take a look.<br/>
<br/>
-Just like the Cauca River, right?<br/>
<br/>
-Identical.<br/>
<br/>
Dad, where are we with the government?<br/>
<br/>
They won't let us use the drug stores<br/>
<br/>
as collateral for the Centenario property<br/>
<br/>
until they're cleared through surrender.<br/>
<br/>
I know, but eventually they will be.<br/>
<br/>
And that's all you can tell me?<br/>
<br/>
You know the rule.<br/>
<br/>
You can't be a part of this.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't send you to law school<br/>
<br/>
so you could worry about our surrender.<br/>
<br/>
That's already been planned.<br/>
<br/>
I sent you to take advantage<br/>
<br/>
of what happens after it's done,<br/>
<br/>
when our family is a leader<br/>
<br/>
in the business community.<br/>
<br/>
You're reading it again?<br/>
<br/>
You should read it once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Wise words.<br/>
<br/>
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
You have a call<br/>
<br/>
from our friend in the capital.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Four people, including three children,<br/>
<br/>
are d*ad and thousands more injured<br/>
<br/>
in a mysterious gas leak<br/>
<br/>
in the area of Yumbo in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Investigators are at the scene<br/>
<br/>
of the incident,<br/>
<br/>
but have not yet discovered<br/>
<br/>
the source of the gas leak.<br/>
<br/>
State officials told residents<br/>
<br/>
there will be a formal investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Can I bum a smoke?<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it dangerous?<br/>
<br/>
No more than it ever was.<br/>
<br/>
If it was a natural gas leak,<br/>
<br/>
I want to know before lighting up.<br/>
<br/>
Unless it's not.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should talk<br/>
<br/>
to the captain, Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.<br/>
<br/>
Off the record.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you talk to him?<br/>
<br/>
He is the district safety inspector.<br/>
<br/>
He'll issue the report.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you ask him for a comment?<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Careful picking it up.<br/>
<br/>
Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.<br/>
<br/>
That's good. A little bit more.<br/>
<br/>
If they connect us to this,<br/>
<br/>
our friend doubts the government<br/>
<br/>
will honor our deal.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be seen as no different<br/>
<br/>
than Escobar, k*ll women and children.<br/>
<br/>
Months of negotiations and money<br/>
<br/>
down the drain.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the poison you monkeys dumped.<br/>
<br/>
There's a reporter asking questions<br/>
<br/>
in Yumbo.<br/>
<br/>
And there's this safety inspector<br/>
<br/>
in charge of the investigation.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of reporters.<br/>
<br/>
But a government investigator!<br/>
<br/>
If the f*ck goes...<br/>
<br/>
Dad, let me take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
I said I would handle it.<br/>
<br/>
You've demonstrated very clearly<br/>
<br/>
that you can't handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Take care of it. Discreetly.<br/>
<br/>
Without any v*olence.<br/>
<br/>
That's the last thing we need.<br/>
<br/>
What? You have another bright idea?<br/>
<br/>
That's why I didn't want our children<br/>
<br/>
in the business.<br/>
<br/>
We made a mistake, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Let go. Turn. Run.<br/>
<br/>
You need to let out some string.<br/>
<br/>
Careful with Grandma.<br/>
<br/>
You see?<br/>
<br/>
This is the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
No, sorry, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
No, this is the living room.<br/>
<br/>
The living room.<br/>
<br/>
It's big, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
And the pool will go here.<br/>
<br/>
And there, the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
And look...<br/>
<br/>
Right in front there,<br/>
<br/>
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.<br/>
<br/>
A jacuzzi?<br/>
<br/>
I always thought your brother<br/>
<br/>
would have...<br/>
<br/>
the house on the hill.<br/>
<br/>
You were just always lost<br/>
<br/>
in your engineering ideas.<br/>
<br/>
What was the last one?<br/>
<br/>
Bio-diesel.<br/>
<br/>
Bio-diesel.<br/>
<br/>
Vegetable gas?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Better late than never.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you like it, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
-Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
-Jorge, the girls are calling you.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm coming. Paola.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be very happy<br/>
<br/>
when you build the house here.<br/>
<br/>
-It's all very nice.<br/>
<br/>
-Affirmative, General.<br/>
<br/>
You impressed him.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care what he thinks.<br/>
<br/>
That's why you haven't told him<br/>
<br/>
who you work for?<br/>
<br/>
It was always temporary.<br/>
<br/>
Temporary?<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
You know this lot is bigger than we need.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but it's the one we want.<br/>
<br/>
It's the one you deserve.<br/>
<br/>
Six more months.<br/>
<br/>
Okay?<br/>
<br/>
I promise.<br/>
<br/>
Go.<br/>
<br/>
I'll go with your parents.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, honey.<br/>
<br/>
-Hello?<br/>
<br/>
-It's me.<br/>
<br/>
-How's everything going, brother?<br/>
<br/>
-All right.<br/>
<br/>
We're about to b*at<br/>
<br/>
our profit record, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Good. Keep me posted.<br/>
<br/>
You should be happy, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Chepe, do me a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Keep a low profile. At least for now.<br/>
<br/>
I got a lot of stuff going on up here<br/>
<br/>
at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I just need more ether<br/>
<br/>
to reach the numbers we talked about.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Is everything all right?<br/>
<br/>
You sound weird.<br/>
<br/>
I'm dealing with a problem<br/>
<br/>
that is stressing me out.<br/>
<br/>
It's our fault.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.<br/>
<br/>
Is it bad?<br/>
<br/>
I hope not.<br/>
<br/>
But it could complicate our surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be careful.<br/>
<br/>
So good you're coming back, brother.<br/>
<br/>
You'll leave behind the hustle<br/>
<br/>
and shit of that city.<br/>
<br/>
It's not so bad.<br/>
<br/>
I love the trees in fall.<br/>
<br/>
The park looks gorgeous.<br/>
<br/>
I love you, brother. Talk soon.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Miss, the valet says<br/>
<br/>
the car hasn't returned.<br/>
<br/>
-I see. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
-You're welcome.<br/>
<br/>
What's happening? Claudio hasn't returned?<br/>
<br/>
No. And Diego?<br/>
<br/>
Diego dragged his drunk ass in<br/>
<br/>
at six in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
-Bye.<br/>
<br/>
-Bye.<br/>
<br/>
I got your message. What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
We have a problem<br/>
<br/>
with the f*cking safety inspector.<br/>
<br/>
He won't accept the money?<br/>
<br/>
He has three crucifixes in his office.<br/>
<br/>
Three.<br/>
<br/>
-Reasoning with him is impossible.<br/>
<br/>
-I see.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, what the hell was David doing<br/>
<br/>
with the chlorine gas?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really want to know?<br/>
<br/>
About a year ago, Don Miguel<br/>
<br/>
and Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.<br/>
<br/>
The idea was to replace the gas<br/>
<br/>
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
They don't check it at Customs...<br/>
<br/>
because it's a poisonous gas.<br/>
<br/>
So that's why David<br/>
<br/>
spilled the gas in Yumbo?<br/>
<br/>
We should let him clean up his own mess.<br/>
<br/>
That's not going to happen, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
If the f*cking inspector doesn't say<br/>
<br/>
what we need him to say, we're all f*cked.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think they're going<br/>
<br/>
to honor the pact?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think there's really<br/>
<br/>
going to be a surrender<br/>
<br/>
between the cartel and the government<br/>
<br/>
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?<br/>
<br/>
Never.<br/>
<br/>
What do we know<br/>
<br/>
about the safety inspector?<br/>
<br/>
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,<br/>
<br/>
his home and office addresses,<br/>
<br/>
bank accounts, income tax, properties.<br/>
<br/>
And the only thing we're sure about?<br/>
<br/>
This f*ck is clean.<br/>
<br/>
There's no one clean in this world,<br/>
<br/>
Córdova. No one.<br/>
<br/>
Find something on him, then. Quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen!<br/>
<br/>
We're going to put all our assets<br/>
<br/>
on this man.<br/>
<br/>
We have to watch his wife, his kids,<br/>
<br/>
even his f*cking dog.<br/>
<br/>
We need to watch his house,<br/>
<br/>
from the inside and out,<br/>
<br/>
every single corner, 24/7.<br/>
<br/>
I want to know what he does at work,<br/>
<br/>
who he meets and where.<br/>
<br/>
I want to know his agenda.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever he does, we're going to find out.<br/>
<br/>
We will be in charge of his f*cking life!<br/>
<br/>
And of course,<br/>
<br/>
we have to tap all his phones.<br/>
<br/>
At home, at the office,<br/>
<br/>
and his cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
-Do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
-Yes, sir!<br/>
<br/>
Come to my house this Saturday<br/>
<br/>
after soccer.<br/>
<br/>
My dad gave me permission.<br/>
<br/>
Awesome, I'll see you there.<br/>
<br/>
Cool, bye.<br/>
<br/>
End of call.<br/>
<br/>
-Recording number two... 2:16 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
-Yes.<br/>
<br/>
The company is registered under<br/>
<br/>
one of the Rodríguez's fake companies.<br/>
<br/>
Recording number three... 4:32 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
I want to suck your dick.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
At the same place.<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am, I'm so sorry to bother you.<br/>
<br/>
It's María. Is Claudio there?<br/>
<br/>
No. Isn't he with you?<br/>
<br/>
No. He didn't come home last night.<br/>
<br/>
I'm worried.<br/>
<br/>
You're fighting again.<br/>
<br/>
You're the reason<br/>
<br/>
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody's seen him.<br/>
<br/>
No one's seen him?<br/>
<br/>
What did you do, María?<br/>
<br/>
-No...<br/>
<br/>
-I'm sending the boys.<br/>
<br/>
No, that's not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know if I hear anything.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Salazar,<br/>
<br/>
will you be checking out today?<br/>
<br/>
Hello, sir.<br/>
<br/>
They're always in room 105.<br/>
<br/>
Very good, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
What a woman.<br/>
<br/>
This was well done.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
The inspector has a press conference<br/>
<br/>
scheduled this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Someone needs to talk to him.<br/>
<br/>
Finish the job.<br/>
<br/>
Don Gilberto, he knows me.<br/>
<br/>
They won't let me in.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge... you should handle it.<br/>
<br/>
You've done such great work.<br/>
<br/>
Great work so far.<br/>
<br/>
And no one knows who he is.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that.<br/>
<br/>
But I only gather information.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, the truth is, I'm a man of...<br/>
<br/>
few words.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest<br/>
<br/>
companies depend on a small outcome<br/>
<br/>
to determine their future.<br/>
<br/>
Like the success of one operation...<br/>
<br/>
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.<br/>
<br/>
This is the final stretch.<br/>
<br/>
We all have to do our part. Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Was there a problem with your last order?<br/>
<br/>
No. No problems.<br/>
<br/>
I need to add another 300 barrels<br/>
<br/>
to my next order.<br/>
<br/>
300 barrels? Mr. Crespo,<br/>
<br/>
that's nearly double. I can't do it.<br/>
<br/>
How come?<br/>
<br/>
There's a new buyer. Their orders<br/>
<br/>
are getting bigger and bigger.<br/>
<br/>
We're already stretched very thin.<br/>
<br/>
I've been your most important client<br/>
<br/>
for years.<br/>
<br/>
I understand, but you told me<br/>
<br/>
you were leaving the business.<br/>
<br/>
-However, this other organization...<br/>
<br/>
-Isn't.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
So who are they?<br/>
<br/>
They're kids.<br/>
<br/>
Dominicans.<br/>
<br/>
Running out of some beauty parlor<br/>
<br/>
in Queens.<br/>
<br/>
I see.<br/>
<br/>
They'll probably end up d*ad or locked up.<br/>
<br/>
You know, it's a young man's world.<br/>
<br/>
We all have to make way<br/>
<br/>
for the next generation.<br/>
<br/>
This beauty parlor in Queens,<br/>
<br/>
give me the address.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the cigarette.<br/>
<br/>
Transportation came out<br/>
<br/>
to $5 million each.<br/>
<br/>
You can see here<br/>
<br/>
that the product loss was very little.<br/>
<br/>
And the bribes?<br/>
<br/>
Well, the payoffs...<br/>
<br/>
they went up this week.<br/>
<br/>
Went up this week to six million, sir.<br/>
<br/>
-Guillermo.<br/>
<br/>
-Yes, sir?<br/>
<br/>
What happens in six months<br/>
<br/>
when these people stop receiving money?<br/>
<br/>
No more friends.<br/>
<br/>
This is everything, right?<br/>
<br/>
This is everything<br/>
<br/>
down to the last penny, sir.<br/>
<br/>
And we have here<br/>
<br/>
coded pages for all the politicians,<br/>
<br/>
the senators, congressmen, all the cops.<br/>
<br/>
I want an exact copy of this book.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
It's our insurance<br/>
<br/>
if they try to f*ck us afterward.<br/>
<br/>
You think someone would dare<br/>
<br/>
do something to you?<br/>
<br/>
Anything can happen.<br/>
<br/>
If you're a p*ssy, they f*ck you.<br/>
<br/>
Any news about Salazar's wife?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Don Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
The girl has been asking<br/>
<br/>
about Claudio everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
You want me to handle it?<br/>
<br/>
I understand you have information<br/>
<br/>
on the Yumbo incident.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do.<br/>
<br/>
Good. Tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Your wife... at the Palace Motel<br/>
<br/>
at 3:45 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
After she dropped the kids off<br/>
<br/>
at soccer practice.<br/>
<br/>
So?<br/>
<br/>
At your press conference this afternoon...<br/>
<br/>
you will announce that the gas leak<br/>
<br/>
was a municipal accident.<br/>
<br/>
We have video and audio as well.<br/>
<br/>
Look... you bought-off monkey...<br/>
<br/>
take these pictures and f*ck yourself.<br/>
<br/>
At the press conference this afternoon,<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to tell the truth,<br/>
<br/>
so that the world will know<br/>
<br/>
what you people do.<br/>
<br/>
And don't worry about my wife.<br/>
<br/>
I already knew.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, we make compromises<br/>
<br/>
to keep a happy home.<br/>
<br/>
I can appreciate you wanting<br/>
<br/>
to take the high road.<br/>
<br/>
However, you're not understanding me.<br/>
<br/>
The men that I work for don't care<br/>
<br/>
about your relationship with your wife.<br/>
<br/>
They care what your children might think,<br/>
<br/>
what their classmates might think.<br/>
<br/>
And your distinguished family.<br/>
<br/>
Think of what they would say<br/>
<br/>
at your church.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't do what I tell you,<br/>
<br/>
the men I work for will make sure<br/>
<br/>
that the whole world<br/>

<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Salazar.<br/>
<br/>
So you've never had<br/>
<br/>
a relaxation treatment before?<br/>
<br/>
I've never heard of it.<br/>
<br/>
Relaxation treatment?<br/>
<br/>
That sounds nice.<br/>
<br/>
You have a funny accent.<br/>
<br/>
-Where are you from?<br/>
<br/>
-Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
-Colombian.<br/>
<br/>
-This guy is Colombian, too.<br/>
<br/>
-Check it out. Both.<br/>
<br/>
-Really?<br/>
<br/>
And I suppose that guy at the door<br/>
<br/>
is also Colombian?<br/>
<br/>
What a small world, right?<br/>
<br/>
All right. What do you want?<br/>
<br/>
I want you to go through that door.<br/>
<br/>
The one with the English writing<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the men back there<br/>
<br/>
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño<br/>
<br/>
is getting a relaxation treatment<br/>
<br/>
and would like to speak with them.<br/>
<br/>
Go.<br/>
<br/>
You stay.<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Please, take a seat.<br/>
<br/>
It's better if I stand.<br/>
<br/>
-A drink?<br/>
<br/>
-No. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for the way<br/>
<br/>
you were brought here.<br/>

I understand you have a question.<br/>
<br/>
I've spent all day<br/>

<br/>
And you think I know the truth?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't think<br/>
<br/>
you are afraid to tell me.<br/>
<br/>
And if I don't tell you?<br/>
<br/>
Then I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
And you are a coward.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband is d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
He was k*ll by an associate of mine.<br/>
<br/>
For a personal injury he caused.<br/>
<br/>
This market, we made it ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
It's ours.<br/>
<br/>
We can't just give it up to you.<br/>
<br/>
You haven't heard my proposal yet.<br/>
<br/>
Say what you got to say.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing you're going to do<br/>
<br/>
is vacate this place immediately,<br/>
<br/>
and never come back.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
And the second? What?<br/>
<br/>
Second...<br/>
<br/>
There is no second. Just the first thing.<br/>
<br/>
-So you think this is a joke?<br/>
<br/>
-Gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Part of being an adult is accepting things<br/>
<br/>
that you wish weren't true.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I have had to accept<br/>
<br/>
some things that I don't like.<br/>
<br/>
I advise you to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Look, you and your f*cking hair<br/>
<br/>
have ten seconds to get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
-Ten.<br/>
<br/>
-Nine.<br/>
<br/>
-Nine.<br/>
<br/>
-Eight.<br/>
<br/>
You think this is funny, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
Seven.<br/>

-Seven.<br/>
<br/>
-Six.<br/>

-Six.<br/>
<br/>
-Five.<br/>
<br/>
-Four.<br/>
<br/>
-Four.<br/>
<br/>
Three, two, one.<br/>

-Check on him.<br/>
<br/>
-Got it.<br/>

""So then the crow flew up<br/>
<br/>
as high as he could,<br/>
<br/>

Good.

-Faster, gentlemen, please.

-Yes, sir.

How's it coming?

This is f*cking cool.

What did I tell you, f*ck?

Stop f*cking around.

I don't want to be here all night.

Understood?

Yes, it's all good.

Let's go.

f*cking idiot.

My dad had 20 years in this shit.

I only have six months.

Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

How many of these things

do we have to empty?

How much f*cking money

do you want to make?

A f*cking lot.

Mrs. Salazar?

Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

-Come back later, please.

-As you wish.

If you want something done right...

you have to do it yourself.

Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

If you don't play,

you're going to watch others score.

My organization has four partners,

but only one leader.

I wanted to meet with you

to make sure there are

no misunderstandings in the North Valley

regarding the restructuring,

and the necessary house cleaning.

No, we were simply curious

about Claudio Salazar's absence.

I will be honest with you.

Salazar never contributed a thing.

He never gave anyone work.

He made more noise than money.

Better said, too much noise.

We are moving forward with the plan,

and we would like to know

if our friends are in agreement.

Your message about the surrender

was very clear,

and was very well received

by all of us in the North Valley.

Have a safe trip home.

Henao... thank you for your friendship.

Excuse me.

Let's take advantage of this window

to maximize our profits.

I'd like to double our output

through Mexico.

Why don't you go there?

Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

Make one last deal.

We both know that isn't the only reason

you're sending me there.

Look, Pacho...

I think it would be best

if you left Cali for a bit...

while things cool off.

Remember, Pacho, we're going

to walk away from this happy and rich.

WHAT IS THE DEA DOING IN CALI?

Wouldn't you have liked

to be born in this era?

Take a look.

-Just like the Cauca River, right?

-Identical.

Dad, where are we with the government?

They won't let us use the drug stores

as collateral for the Centenario property

until they're cleared through surrender.

I know, but eventually they will be.

And that's all you can tell me?

You know the rule.

You can't be a part of this.

I didn't send you to law school

so you could worry about our surrender.

That's already been planned.

I sent you to take advantage

of what happens after it's done,

when our family is a leader

in the business community.

You're reading it again?

You should read it once in a while.

Wise words.

Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

You have a call

from our friend in the capital.

Hello?

Four people, including three children,

are d*ad and thousands more injured

in a mysterious gas leak

in the area of Yumbo in Cali.

Investigators are at the scene

of the incident,

but have not yet discovered

the source of the gas leak.

State officials told residents

there will be a formal investigation.

Can I bum a smoke?

Isn't it dangerous?

No more than it ever was.

If it was a natural gas leak,

I want to know before lighting up.

Unless it's not.

I think you should talk

to the captain, Carolina.

He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

Silvio, help me out. You have kids.

Off the record.

I don't know, Carolina.

Why don't you talk to him?

He is the district safety inspector.

He'll issue the report.

Why don't you ask him for a comment?

Excuse me.

Careful picking it up.

Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.

That's good. A little bit more.

If they connect us to this,

our friend doubts the government

will honor our deal.

We'll be seen as no different

than Escobar, k*ll women and children.

Months of negotiations and money

down the drain.

Just like the poison you monkeys dumped.

There's a reporter asking questions

in Yumbo.

And there's this safety inspector

in charge of the investigation.

I wouldn't worry about the reporter.

We have lots of reporters.

But a government investigator!

If the f*ck goes...

Dad, let me take care of it.

I said I would handle it.

You've demonstrated very clearly

that you can't handle it.

Take care of it. Discreetly.

Without any v*olence.

That's the last thing we need.

What? You have another bright idea?

That's why I didn't want our children

in the business.

We made a mistake, Gilberto.

Let go. Turn. Run.

You need to let out some string.

Careful with Grandma.

You see?

This is the bedroom.

No, sorry, Dad.

No, this is the living room.

The living room.

It's big, Jorge.

And the pool will go here.

And there, the kitchen.

And look...

Right in front there,

I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

A jacuzzi?

I always thought your brother

would have...

the house on the hill.

You were just always lost

in your engineering ideas.

What was the last one?

Bio-diesel.

Bio-diesel.

Vegetable gas?

Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

Well...

Very good.

Better late than never.

I'm glad you like it, Dad.

-Thank you.

-Jorge, the girls are calling you.

Yes, I'm coming. Paola.

You'll be very happy

when you build the house here.

-It's all very nice.

-Affirmative, General.

You impressed him.

I don't care what he thinks.

That's why you haven't told him

who you work for?

It was always temporary.

Temporary?

Right.

You know this lot is bigger than we need.

Yes, but it's the one we want.

It's the one you deserve.

Six more months.

Okay?

I promise.

Go.

I'll go with your parents.

I'm sorry, honey.

-Hello?

-It's me.

-How's everything going, brother?

-All right.

We're about to b*at

our profit record, brother.

Good. Keep me posted.

You should be happy, Gilberto.

Chepe, do me a favor.

Keep a low profile. At least for now.

I got a lot of stuff going on up here

at the moment.

I just need more ether

to reach the numbers we talked about.

Why? Is everything all right?

You sound weird.

I'm dealing with a problem

that is stressing me out.

It's our fault.

Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.

Is it bad?

I hope not.

But it could complicate our surrender.

Okay.

I'll be careful.

So good you're coming back, brother.

You'll leave behind the hustle

and shit of that city.

It's not so bad.

I love the trees in fall.

The park looks gorgeous.

I love you, brother. Talk soon.

Okay.

Miss, the valet says

the car hasn't returned.

-I see. Thank you.

-You're welcome.

What's happening? Claudio hasn't returned?

No. And Diego?

Diego dragged his drunk ass in

at six in the morning.

Okay.

-Bye.

-Bye.

I got your message. What's going on?

We have a problem

with the f*cking safety inspector.

He won't accept the money?

He has three crucifixes in his office.

Three.

-Reasoning with him is impossible.

-I see.

Tell me, what the hell was David doing

with the chlorine gas?

Do you really want to know?

About a year ago, Don Miguel

and Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

The idea was to replace the gas

with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

They don't check it at Customs...

because it's a poisonous gas.

So that's why David

spilled the gas in Yumbo?

We should let him clean up his own mess.

That's not going to happen, Jorge.

If the f*cking inspector doesn't say

what we need him to say, we're all f*cked.

Do you think they're going

to honor the pact?

Do you think there's really

going to be a surrender

between the cartel and the government

if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

Never.

What do we know

about the safety inspector?

Here's everything. We have phone numbers,

his home and office addresses,

bank accounts, income tax, properties.

And the only thing we're sure about?

This f*ck is clean.

There's no one clean in this world,

Córdova. No one.

Find something on him, then. Quickly.

Gentlemen!

We're going to put all our assets

on this man.

We have to watch his wife, his kids,

even his f*cking dog.

We need to watch his house,

from the inside and out,

every single corner, 24/7.

I want to know what he does at work,

who he meets and where.

I want to know his agenda.

Whatever he does, we're going to find out.

We will be in charge of his f*cking life!

And of course,

we have to tap all his phones.

At home, at the office,

and his cell phone.

-Do you understand?

-Yes, sir!

Come to my house this Saturday

after soccer.

My dad gave me permission.

Awesome, I'll see you there.

Cool, bye.

End of call.

-Recording number two... 2:16 p.m.

-Yes.

The company is registered under

one of the Rodríguez's fake companies.

Recording number three... 4:32 p.m.

I want to suck your dick.

Tomorrow.

At the same place.

Ma'am, I'm so sorry to bother you.

It's María. Is Claudio there?

No. Isn't he with you?

No. He didn't come home last night.

I'm worried.

You're fighting again.

You're the reason

he seeks pleasure elsewhere.

Nobody's seen him.

No one's seen him?

What did you do, María?

-No...

-I'm sending the boys.

No, that's not necessary.

I'll let you know if I hear anything.

Mrs. Salazar,

will you be checking out today?

Hello, sir.

They're always in room 105.

Very good, thank you.

What a woman.

This was well done.

Thank you, sir.

The inspector has a press conference

scheduled this afternoon.

Someone needs to talk to him.

Finish the job.

Don Gilberto, he knows me.

They won't let me in.

Jorge... you should handle it.

You've done such great work.

Great work so far.

And no one knows who he is.

I appreciate that.

But I only gather information.

Sir, the truth is, I'm a man of...

few words.

Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest

companies depend on a small outcome

to determine their future.

Like the success of one operation...

or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

This is the final stretch.

We all have to do our part. Understood?

Yes, sir.

Was there a problem with your last order?

No. No problems.

I need to add another 300 barrels

to my next order.

300 barrels? Mr. Crespo,

that's nearly double. I can't do it.

How come?

There's a new buyer. Their orders

are getting bigger and bigger.

We're already stretched very thin.

I've been your most important client

for years.

I understand, but you told me

you were leaving the business.

-However, this other organization...

-Isn't.

I'm sorry.

So who are they?

They're kids.

Dominicans.

Running out of some beauty parlor

in Queens.

I see.

They'll probably end up d*ad or locked up.

You know, it's a young man's world.

We all have to make way

for the next generation.

This beauty parlor in Queens,

give me the address.

But...

Thanks for the cigarette.

Transportation came out

to $5 million each.

You can see here

that the product loss was very little.

And the bribes?

Well, the payoffs...

they went up this week.

Went up this week to six million, sir.

-Guillermo.

-Yes, sir?

What happens in six months

when these people stop receiving money?

No more friends.

This is everything, right?

This is everything

down to the last penny, sir.

And we have here

coded pages for all the politicians,

the senators, congressmen, all the cops.

I want an exact copy of this book.

Yes, sir.

It's our insurance

if they try to f*ck us afterward.

You think someone would dare

do something to you?

Anything can happen.

If you're a p*ssy, they f*ck you.

Any news about Salazar's wife?

Yes, Don Miguel.

The girl has been asking

about Claudio everywhere.

You want me to handle it?

I understand you have information

on the Yumbo incident.

Yes, I do.

Good. Tell me.

Your wife... at the Palace Motel

at 3:45 p.m.

After she dropped the kids off

at soccer practice.

So?

At your press conference this afternoon...

you will announce that the gas leak

was a municipal accident.

We have video and audio as well.

Look... you bought-off monkey...

take these pictures and f*ck yourself.

At the press conference this afternoon,

I'm going to tell the truth,

so that the world will know

what you people do.

And don't worry about my wife.

I already knew.

Sometimes, we make compromises

to keep a happy home.

I can appreciate you wanting

to take the high road.

However, you're not understanding me.

The men that I work for don't care

about your relationship with your wife.

They care what your children might think,

what their classmates might think.

And your distinguished family.

Think of what they would say

at your church.

If you don't do what I tell you,

the men I work for will make sure

that the whole world

will have a copy of this tape.

Thank you.

Mrs. Salazar.

So you've never had

a relaxation treatment before?

I've never heard of it.

Relaxation treatment?

That sounds nice.

You have a funny accent.

-Where are you from?

-Colombia.

-Colombian.

-This guy is Colombian, too.

-Check it out. Both.

-Really?

And I suppose that guy at the door

is also Colombian?

What a small world, right?

All right. What do you want?

I want you to go through that door.

The one with the English writing

I don't understand.

Tell the men back there

that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

is getting a relaxation treatment

and would like to speak with them.

Go.

You stay.

Cool.

Please, take a seat.

It's better if I stand.

-A drink?

-No. Thank you.

I'm sorry for the way

you were brought here.

I understand you have a question.

I've spent all day

asking about my husband.

And you think I know the truth?

Yes.

And I don't think

you are afraid to tell me.

And if I don't tell you?

Then I was wrong.

And you are a coward.

Your husband is d*ad.

He was k*ll by an associate of mine.

For a personal injury he caused.

This market, we made it ourselves.

It's ours.

We can't just give it up to you.

You haven't heard my proposal yet.

Say what you got to say.

The first thing you're going to do

is vacate this place immediately,

and never come back.

Oh, yeah?

And the second? What?

Second...

There is no second. Just the first thing.

-So you think this is a joke?

-Gentlemen.

Part of being an adult is accepting things

that you wish weren't true.

Recently, I have had to accept

some things that I don't like.

-Ten.

-Nine.

-Nine.

-Eight.

You think this is funny, f*ck?

Seven.

-Seven.

-Six.

-Six.

-Five.

-Four.

-Four.

Three, two, one.

-Check on him.

-Got it.

""So then the crow flew up

But tonight, after the announcement,<br/>
<br/>
we'll know the truth.<br/>
<br/>
You're more superstitious than Aunt Luz.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Is everything ready?<br/>
<br/>
It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.<br/>
<br/>
You can handle it, you're young.<br/>
<br/>
We're meeting Córdova.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to go over the game plan.<br/>
<br/>
Big night tonight, right?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of company.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen. Let's start with the obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight is f*cking important.<br/>
<br/>
The Rodríguez brothers never...<br/>
<br/>
gather members of their organization<br/>
<br/>
in one place.<br/>
<br/>
That simply never happens.<br/>
<br/>
But tonight, they're going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
So we have to be sharp.<br/>
<br/>
-Eyes in the back of the head, understood?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Stay focused.<br/>
<br/>
Stay on the radio. Communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight is his last operation.<br/>
<br/>
He's leaving us<br/>
<br/>
to become a fancy businessman.<br/>
<br/>
Let's leave a good impression.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he'll hire us one day.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think Gilberto<br/>
<br/>
is going to announce tonight?<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a move into the Asian market.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
After Friday, it's not my problem.<br/>
<br/>
Are you really leaving?<br/>
<br/>
I promised Paola.<br/>
<br/>
I promise things<br/>
<br/>
to my wife every day, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, you'll find someone else<br/>
<br/>
to make you look good.<br/>
<br/>
I hope so, buddy.<br/>
<br/>
Because right now,<br/>
<br/>
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.<br/>
<br/>
Who am I speaking with?<br/>
<br/>
This is Andres, his brother.<br/>
<br/>
And how can I help him?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, brother. Have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Something to drink?<br/>
<br/>
Relax. You're safe here.<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk about tonight's party.<br/>
<br/>
We need info on the people attending.<br/>
<br/>
Cops, politicians.<br/>
<br/>
-Cops and politicians?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Who work for the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
These people are ruining your country.<br/>
<br/>
Look, the thing is, these people<br/>
<br/>
never get together in one place.<br/>
<br/>
We need to know why now.<br/>
<br/>
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez<br/>
<br/>
is making some kind<br/>
<br/>
of important announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Understand?<br/>
<br/>
Come in.<br/>
<br/>
We were getting worried. Everything okay?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but...<br/>
<br/>
I thought someone was tailing me.<br/>
<br/>
I had to make sure I was alone.<br/>
<br/>
Take off your shirt. Sit.<br/>
<br/>
Ready.<br/>
<br/>
Look, don't you think you should<br/>
<br/>
fix things with Pacho, Claudito?<br/>
<br/>
He's a boss.<br/>
<br/>
We're in their territory, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I'll fix it tonight.<br/>
<br/>
For our children,<br/>
<br/>
and our children's children.<br/>
<br/>
That sounded great, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Let me do it from the top.<br/>
<br/>
No one gives a shit about your speech.<br/>
<br/>
We can hear it after...<br/>
<br/>
Come here, you crazy f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
Look at you. How's New York?<br/>
<br/>
Cold. But if you ask nicely,<br/>
<br/>
the girls make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
I brought you something, baby-face.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
It's been too long<br/>
<br/>
since we were all together.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight is our night,<br/>
<br/>
because we've earned this.<br/>
<br/>
-Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!<br/>
<br/>
- Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
I think there is business<br/>
<br/>
to discuss first, Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
You're acting like someone<br/>
<br/>
just pissed you off.<br/>
<br/>
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.<br/>
<br/>
But I work more than him.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, then!<br/>
<br/>
To the Pope!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, Chepe.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Gilberto...<br/>
<br/>
you know I have a personal issue<br/>
<br/>
with that son of a bitch,<br/>
<br/>
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.<br/>
<br/>
And he's downstairs.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to solve it.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your need for revenge,<br/>
<br/>
but this isn't the time to get into it.<br/>
<br/>
There's too much at stake.<br/>
<br/>
Well... shall we enjoy<br/>
<br/>
this expensive party or what?<br/>
<br/>
No. Instead, let's listen<br/>
<br/>
to Gilberto's speech again.<br/>
<br/>
Chepe, you f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.<br/>
<br/>
I pay him money every month.<br/>
<br/>
I pay all these people.<br/>
<br/>
Well done, big sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
It's not your money.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm the one who controls it.<br/>
<br/>
-Who bought you these earrings?<br/>
<br/>
- Guillermo. Enough.<br/>
<br/>
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.<br/>
<br/>
Shit. Get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
-How are you, sir?<br/>
<br/>
- Pallomari.<br/>
<br/>
-Enjoying the party?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see you.<br/>
<br/>
Don Gilberto, good evening.<br/>
<br/>
-Welcome, Mr. Mayor.<br/>
<br/>
- Don Gilberto, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
Good evening, Don Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
-Look, here it is.<br/>
<br/>
- f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
-Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
- Can I have aguardiente with ice?<br/>
<br/>
-Of course.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Are you...<br/>
<br/>
enjoying yourself?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Very much, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
María Salazar.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for having us.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Rodríguez would like<br/>
<br/>
for his associates<br/>
<br/>
to join him in the equestrian ring<br/>
<br/>
for an announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Please, go right ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers<br/>
<br/>
towards the s*ab. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Stop there.<br/>
<br/>
You must be using some high-end equipment<br/>
<br/>
if you're getting anything<br/>
<br/>
in this shitty light.<br/>
<br/>
Who are you?<br/>
<br/>
I'm in charge of security<br/>
<br/>
for the Rodríguez brothers.<br/>
<br/>
See that man over there?<br/>
<br/>
His name is Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what he does?<br/>
<br/>
Either you come with me,<br/>
<br/>
or you go with him.<br/>
<br/>
You understand?<br/>
<br/>
Follow me.<br/>
<br/>
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.<br/>
<br/>
You live with your mother<br/>
<br/>
in commune number 3.<br/>
<br/>
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.<br/>
<br/>
Your brother is Lucho.<br/>
<br/>
He's in federal custody<br/>
<br/>
in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
That's why you agreed to work for the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Don't lie to me.<br/>
<br/>
Andrés, you made a bad decision.<br/>
<br/>
But I think you're smart enough<br/>
<br/>
to realize that.<br/>
<br/>
You have another decision to make,<br/>
<br/>
and it's the only way to get out alive.<br/>
<br/>
Leave Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Don't say goodbye to your mother<br/>
<br/>
or to your girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Associates.<br/>
<br/>
Friends.<br/>
<br/>
Our enemy is d*ad!<br/>
<br/>
Our business is strong!<br/>
<br/>
Together we have taken this business<br/>
<br/>
to heights that our predecessors<br/>
<br/>
couldn't have imagined.<br/>
<br/>
But friends... there's circumstances<br/>
<br/>
that we need to acknowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
The law enforcement spotlight will shine<br/>
<br/>
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
And so, while we celebrate,<br/>
<br/>
they will do everything they can<br/>
<br/>
to take away everything we've built.<br/>
<br/>
An American named Joseph Kennedy<br/>
<br/>
made his fortune<br/>
<br/>
selling bootlegged liquor,<br/>
<br/>
but he turned that money into legitimacy.<br/>
<br/>
His children, great politicians.<br/>
<br/>
And one of them<br/>
<br/>
was even elected president.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, gentlemen, we have been negotiating<br/>
<br/>
with the authorities,<br/>
<br/>
and soon we will reach an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Our organization, within six months,<br/>
<br/>
will be out of the cocaine business.<br/>
<br/>
We will surrender our labs,<br/>
<br/>
our safe houses,<br/>
<br/>
and our tr*ffick routes.<br/>
<br/>
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake<br/>
<br/>
of thinking it won't be on our terms.<br/>
<br/>
Any prison sentences will be minimal.<br/>
<br/>
Our money will remain ours.<br/>
<br/>
Our legitimate businesses<br/>
<br/>
will continue to grow.<br/>
<br/>
We have six months to make<br/>
<br/>
as much money as possible!<br/>
<br/>
And gentlemen,<br/>
<br/>
as a token of our friendship,<br/>
<br/>
we'll give each of you a juicy share<br/>
<br/>
of the final profits from this year.<br/>
<br/>
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
For our children...<br/>
<br/>
and our children's children!<br/>
<br/>
-Cheers...<br/>
<br/>
- Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
-Cheers, gentlemen!<br/>
<br/>
- Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
-What did you think?<br/>
<br/>
- I think it's a great move.<br/>
<br/>
-Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
- For the future!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming.<br/>
<br/>
What would you like?<br/>
<br/>
Whiskey. Dry.<br/>
<br/>
Six months.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to bleed New York dry.<br/>
<br/>
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty<br/>
<br/>
and f*ck her right up her ass.<br/>
<br/>
And then what?<br/>
<br/>
<div class=""ads ads-topic topic-content""><ins class=""adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-3808023418243141"" data-ad-slot=""1728561479"" data-full-width-responsive=""true"" style=""display:inline-block""></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<br/>
We only have six months<br/>
<br/>
of doing whatever the f*ck we want?<br/>
<br/>
I love you, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you on the dance floor.<br/>
<br/>
-Can you get in the car, please?<br/>
<br/>
- Why do you want to leave so early?<br/>
<br/>
Because it's time, okay?<br/>
<br/>
-Why are you treating me like this?<br/>
<br/>
- That's enough!<br/>
<br/>
Get in the car.<br/>
<br/>
How was everything tonight, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
Very good, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think we surprised them?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I think you surprised many people.<br/>
<br/>
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.<br/>
<br/>
What happened there?<br/>
<br/>
Don't be modest.<br/>
<br/>
Córdova told me.<br/>
<br/>
It's your talent.<br/>
<br/>
Spotting the thr*at,<br/>
<br/>
knowing when they're going to f*ck us.<br/>
<br/>
It's priceless.<br/>
<br/>
I'm told you want to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I'm grateful to you<br/>
<br/>
and your family, but...<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting my own security firm.<br/>
<br/>
I only wanted to stay until...<br/>
<br/>
Escobar stopped being a thr*at.<br/>
<br/>
And we are very grateful. Honestly.<br/>
<br/>
You have done great things for us<br/>
<br/>
over the years.<br/>
<br/>
For my family. For me.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect,<br/>
<br/>
I've already made arrangements...<br/>
<br/>
Arrangements can change.<br/>
<br/>
Look, we didn't get where we are<br/>
<br/>
by allowing good people to leave.<br/>
<br/>
We will need you more than ever<br/>
<br/>
in the months ahead.<br/>
<br/>
It's only six months.<br/>
<br/>
Can I count on you, Jorge?<br/>
<br/>
Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, boss.<br/>
<br/>
The same.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Hello? Who is this?<br/>
<br/>
NATIONAL POLICE<br/>
<br/>
Who am I speaking with?<br/>
<br/>
Here it is, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Don Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
This just arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Put them on.<br/>
<br/>
Subject's name: Díaz.<br/>
<br/>
Recorded at El Nacional Hotel. Room 117.<br/>
<br/>
Retirement works for these f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
They're rich.<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a brand new plane.<br/>
<br/>
So that f*ck Gilberto<br/>
<br/>
can shove it up his ass.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, who are they to make a deal<br/>
<br/>
without consulting with us?<br/>
<br/>
They don't get to surrender on our behalf.<br/>
<br/>
That son of a bitch Díaz.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to send Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
Subject's name: Santos.<br/>
<br/>
Recorded in zone 4.<br/>
<br/>
They're going to have to give me more<br/>
<br/>
than that f*cking wrapping paper.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking balls on the old goat<br/>
<br/>
to tell me how to run my business.<br/>
<br/>
That's not going to be so easy.<br/>
<br/>
These men are weak.<br/>
<br/>
I'll handle that one myself.<br/>
<br/>
The man is an animal.<br/>
<br/>
Subject name: Beltre.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to wait for Rasguño or Henao<br/>
<br/>
to snatch the good territories.<br/>
<br/>
Let's organize<br/>
<br/>
so we can put a move together now.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck Joseph Kennedy,<br/>
<br/>
whoever that assh*le is.<br/>
<br/>
El Pecas will handle that one.<br/>
<br/>
You got it, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Subject name: Salazar.<br/>
<br/>
María, I'll be back soon.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going out with some friends.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, Claudio?<br/>
<br/>
You're going out now?<br/>
<br/>
Please don't look at me like that.<br/>
<br/>
It's one o'clock in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly, María. It's one o'clock.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your voice down<br/>
<br/>
so you don't wake the guests.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck off, Claudio. Go with your whores.<br/>
<br/>
Don't f*ck with me, María,<br/>
<br/>
because I'm tired<br/>
<br/>
from clapping all night<br/>
<br/>
for that f*ck's bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Don't f*ck with me.<br/>
<br/>
Well... that's husband and wife business.<br/>
<br/>
Leave him out.<br/>
<br/>
No, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Salazar shows no respect.<br/>
<br/>
Better safe than sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Honey. What time is it?<br/>
<br/>
It's late.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
How was work?<br/>
<br/>
Fine.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
And?<br/>
<br/>
He asked me not to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Just for a little while.<br/>
<br/>
How long?<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking you how long.<br/>
<br/>
-Six months.<br/>
<br/>
- Six months?<br/>
<br/>
What did you tell him?<br/>
<br/>
What could I tell him? It's six months.<br/>
<br/>
We've talked about this for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
You're telling me we can't start our new<br/>
<br/>
lives because we have to wait six months?<br/>
<br/>
You know what? I don't think<br/>
<br/>
you really want to leave this job.<br/>
<br/>
-How can you say that?<br/>
<br/>
- You think I'm an idiot?<br/>
<br/>
You like working for them.<br/>
<br/>
It's become your life.<br/>
<br/>
You are my life. The girls are my life.<br/>
<br/>
-What do you want me to do?<br/>
<br/>
- Don't say another word.<br/>
<br/>
-It's six months, not six years.<br/>
<br/>
- Not another word.<br/>
<br/>
She owns a spa.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go. We should go!<br/>
<br/>
What can I get you?<br/>
<br/>
A bottle of aguardiente,<br/>
<br/>
and play ""Dos Gardenias"" for me.<br/>
<br/>
Gladly, Don Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Please, Claudio...<br/>
<br/>
accept this as a token of respect.<br/>
<br/>
To let bygones be bygones.<br/>
<br/>
You know what, Pacho?<br/>
<br/>
I think our differences are in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right back to share it with you.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
And now... the bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
-Pacho, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
- Pacho, please.<br/>
<br/>
Don't do this. Don't do this to me.<br/>
<br/>
Please, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Pacho, please! Pacho, wait!<br/>
<br/>
Please, let's talk. Pacho!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't do anything to you.<br/>
<br/>
Pacho, you f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Wait, Pacho! Pacho, son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
Please, no!<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
Pacho, son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
No!<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch, Pacho!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!</div>]","Thank you for being here with us,

with the groom and the bride.

Come and dance with us, everyone.

Let's begin.

Congratulations.

-Don Chucho.

- Luis, how are you?

How are you, sir?

Hello, Paco.

Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

Will you tell me something?

What happened to you over there?

-Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.

- But you want to go back?

Sir, here you are.

Thank you.

FOR BEING FRIENDS

WITH PABLO ESCOBAR - LOS PEPES

Hello.

Yes. What's up?

Let's see.

Two more hours here.

-Palmira's police superintendent.

- Didn't we just take care of him?

-I'm talking about the new one, Arango.

- How much?

-Should I put $20,000?

- No.

Put 17.

-Seventeen?

- Yes.

Anderson! Move all that over to the left.

The tables are too close together.

Are you planning on saying

anything tonight?

No.

I'll speak for the both of us.

-Did you talk to the North Valley people?

- Yes.

And?

They said what they thought

I wanted to hear.

But tonight, after the announcement,

we'll know the truth.

You're more superstitious than Aunt Luz.

Hey, boss.

Is everything ready?

It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.

You can handle it, you're young.

We're meeting Córdova.

He wants to go over the game plan.

Big night tonight, right?

Lots of company.

Gentlemen. Let's start with the obvious.

Tonight is f*cking important.

The Rodríguez brothers never...

gather members of their organization

in one place.

That simply never happens.

But tonight, they're going to do it.

So we have to be sharp.

-Eyes in the back of the head, understood?

- Yes, sir.

Stay focused.

Stay on the radio. Communicate.

Tonight is his last operation.

He's leaving us

to become a fancy businessman.

Let's leave a good impression.

Maybe he'll hire us one day.

Let's go.

What do you think Gilberto

is going to announce tonight?

I think it's a move into the Asian market.

I have no idea.

After Friday, it's not my problem.

Are you really leaving?

I promised Paola.

I promise things

to my wife every day, brother.

Relax, you'll find someone else

to make you look good.

I hope so, buddy.

Because right now,

I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

Who am I speaking with?

This is Andres, his brother.

And how can I help him?

Hey, brother. Have a seat.

Something to drink?

Relax. You're safe here.

Let's talk about tonight's party.

We need info on the people attending.

Cops, politicians.

-Cops and politicians?

- Yes.

Who work for the cartel.

These people are ruining your country.

Look, the thing is, these people

never get together in one place.

We need to know why now.

Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

is making some kind

of important announcement.

Understand?

Come in.

We were getting worried. Everything okay?

Yes, but...

I thought someone was tailing me.

I had to make sure I was alone.

Take off your shirt. Sit.

Ready.

Look, don't you think you should

fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

He's a boss.

We're in their territory, right?

Yes.

I'll fix it tonight.

For our children,

and our children's children.

That sounded great, brother.

Let me do it from the top.

No one gives a shit about your speech.

We can hear it after...

Come here, you crazy f*ck.

What's up?

Look at you. How's New York?

Cold. But if you ask nicely,

the girls make up for it.

I brought you something, baby-face.

Thank you!

It's been too long

since we were all together.

Tonight is our night,

because we've earned this.

-Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!

- Cheers!

I think there is business

to discuss first, Gilberto.

You're acting like someone

just pissed you off.

Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

But I work more than him.

Cheers, then!

To the Pope!

Welcome, Chepe.

Look, Gilberto...

you know I have a personal issue

with that son of a bitch,

Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

And he's downstairs.

I would like to solve it.

Okay, Pacho.

I understand your need for revenge,

but this isn't the time to get into it.

There's too much at stake.

Well... shall we enjoy

this expensive party or what?

No. Instead, let's listen

to Gilberto's speech again.

Chepe, you f*ck.

Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

I pay him money every month.

I pay all these people.

Well done, big sh*t.

It's not your money.

But I'm the one who controls it.

-Who bought you these earrings?

- Guillermo. Enough.

Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

Shit. Get out of here.

-How are you, sir?

- Pallomari.

-Enjoying the party?

- Yes.

Yes.

Nice to see you.

Don Gilberto, good evening.

-Welcome, Mr. Mayor.

- Don Gilberto, how are you?

Good evening, Don Gilberto.

-Look, here it is.

- f*ck.

Hello.

-Good evening.

- Can I have aguardiente with ice?

-Of course.

- Thank you.

Are you...

enjoying yourself?

Yes. Very much, thank you.

Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

María Salazar.

Thank you for having us.

Good evening.

Mr. Rodríguez would like

for his associates

to join him in the equestrian ring

for an announcement.

Please, go right ahead.

Gentlemen, please follow the ushers

towards the s*ab. Thank you.

Stop there.

You must be using some high-end equipment

if you're getting anything

in this shitty light.

Who are you?

I'm in charge of security

for the Rodríguez brothers.

See that man over there?

His name is Navegante.

Guess what he does?

Either you come with me,

or you go with him.

You understand?

Follow me.

Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

You live with your mother

in commune number 3.

You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

Your brother is Lucho.

He's in federal custody

in the United States.

That's why you agreed to work for the DEA.

Don't lie to me.

Andrés, you made a bad decision.

But I think you're smart enough

to realize that.

You have another decision to make,

and it's the only way to get out alive.

Leave Cali.

Don't say goodbye to your mother

or to your girlfriend.

I need you to disappear.

Associates.

Friends.

Our enemy is d*ad!

Our business is strong!

Together we have taken this business

to heights that our predecessors

couldn't have imagined.

But friends... there's circumstances

that we need to acknowledge.

Listen to me.

The law enforcement spotlight will shine

brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.

And so, while we celebrate,

they will do everything they can

to take away everything we've built.

An American named Joseph Kennedy

made his fortune

selling bootlegged liquor,

but he turned that money into legitimacy.

His children, great politicians.

And one of them

was even elected president.

Yes, gentlemen, we have been negotiating

with the authorities,

and soon we will reach an agreement.

Our organization, within six months,

will be out of the cocaine business.

We will surrender our labs,

our safe houses,

and our tr*ffick routes.

But gentlemen, don't make the mistake

of thinking it won't be on our terms.

Any prison sentences will be minimal.

Our money will remain ours.

Our legitimate businesses

will continue to grow.

We have six months to make

as much money as possible!

And gentlemen,

as a token of our friendship,

we'll give each of you a juicy share

of the final profits from this year.

To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

For our children...

and our children's children!

-Cheers...

- Cheers!

-Cheers, gentlemen!

- Cheers!

-What did you think?

- I think it's a great move.

-Congratulations!

- For the future!

Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming.

What would you like?

Whiskey. Dry.

Six months.

I'm going to bleed New York dry.

Come up behind the Statue of Liberty

and f*ck her right up her ass.

And then what?

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

We only have six months

of doing whatever the f*ck we want?

I love you, brother.

I'll see you on the dance floor.

-Can you get in the car, please?

- Why do you want to leave so early?

Because it's time, okay?

-Why are you treating me like this?

- That's enough!

Get in the car.

How was everything tonight, Jorge?

Very good, sir.

Do you think we surprised them?

Yes. I think you surprised many people.

I'm told we had an uninvited guest.

What happened there?

Don't be modest.

Córdova told me.

It's your talent.

Spotting the thr*at,

knowing when they're going to f*ck us.

It's priceless.

I'm told you want to leave.

I'm grateful to you

and your family, but...

I'm starting my own security firm.

I only wanted to stay until...

Escobar stopped being a thr*at.

And we are very grateful. Honestly.

You have done great things for us

over the years.

For my family. For me.

I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

With all due respect,

I've already made arrangements...

Arrangements can change.

Look, we didn't get where we are

by allowing good people to leave.

We will need you more than ever

in the months ahead.

It's only six months.

Can I count on you, Jorge?

Yes?

Of course, boss.

The same.

Thanks.

Hello?

Hello? Who is this?

NATIONAL POLICE

Who am I speaking with?

Here it is, sir.

Thank you.

Don Gilberto.

This just arrived.

Put them on.

Subject's name: Díaz.

Recorded at El Nacional Hotel. Room 117.

Retirement works for these f*ck.

They're rich.

I just bought a brand new plane.

So that f*ck Gilberto

can shove it up his ass.

Besides, who are they to make a deal

without consulting with us?

They don't get to surrender on our behalf.

That son of a bitch Díaz.

I'm going to send Navegante.

Subject's name: Santos.

Recorded in zone 4.

They're going to have to give me more

than that f*cking wrapping paper.

f*cking balls on the old goat

to tell me how to run my business.

That's not going to be so easy.

These men are weak.

I'll handle that one myself.

The man is an animal.

Subject name: Beltre.

I'm not going to wait for Rasguño or Henao

to snatch the good territories.

Let's organize

so we can put a move together now.

f*ck Joseph Kennedy,

whoever that assh*le is.

El Pecas will handle that one.

You got it, sir.

Subject name: Salazar.

María, I'll be back soon.

I'm going out with some friends.

What do you mean, Claudio?

You're going out now?

Please don't look at me like that.

It's one o'clock in the morning.

Exactly, María. It's one o'clock.

Keep your voice down

so you don't wake the guests.

f*ck off, Claudio. Go with your whores.

Don't f*ck with me, María,

because I'm tired

from clapping all night

for that f*ck's bullshit.

Don't f*ck with me.

Well... that's husband and wife business.

Leave him out.

No, brother.

Salazar shows no respect.

Better safe than sorry.

Honey. What time is it?

It's late.

Go back to sleep.

How was work?

Fine.

I spoke with Miguel.

And?

He asked me not to leave.

Just for a little while.

How long?

I'm asking you how long.

-Six months.

- Six months?

What did you tell him?

What could I tell him? It's six months.

We've talked about this for a long time.

You're telling me we can't start our new

lives because we have to wait six months?

You know what? I don't think

you really want to leave this job.

-How can you say that?

- You think I'm an idiot?

You like working for them.

It's become your life.

You are my life. The girls are my life.

-What do you want me to do?

- Don't say another word.

-It's six months, not six years.

- Not another word.

She owns a spa.

Let's go. We should go!

What can I get you?

A bottle of aguardiente,

and play ""Dos Gardenias"" for me.

Gladly, Don Pacho.

Thank you.

Please, Claudio...

accept this as a token of respect.

To let bygones be bygones.

You know what, Pacho?

I think our differences are in the past.

I'll be right back to share it with you.

Excuse me.

Please.

And now... the bottle.

Go ahead.

-Pacho, f*ck!

- Pacho, please.

Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

Please, Pacho.

Pacho, please! Pacho, wait!

Please, let's talk. Pacho!

f*ck.

He didn't do anything to you.

Pacho, you f*ck!

Wait, Pacho! Pacho, son of a bitch!

Please, no!

Son of a bitch!

Pacho, son of a bitch!

No!

Son of a bitch, Pacho!

f*ck!"

Pablo Escobar!<br/>
<br/>
PABLO ESCOBAR PRESIDENT<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
How are you, Mr. President?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Please come in, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
- All yours.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday to you<br/>
<br/>
- Happy birthday to you<br/>
- What's this?<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday, dear Pablo<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday to you<br/>
<br/>
Bravo, Pablito!<br/>
<br/>
I love you, son.<br/>
Don't eat the whole cake.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to blow out the candles,<br/>
Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday, Daddy!<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, we miss you so much.<br/>
<br/>
We wish we could be there with you.<br/>
<br/>
I know, my love.<br/>
<br/>
Soon this will all be behind us.<br/>
<br/>
I promise.<br/>
<br/>
Good morning, boss.<br/>
<br/>
I made some eggs.<br/>
<br/>
- There's leftover cake.<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I got everything we need, boss.<br/>
<br/>
You went to a different store, correct?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
I go to a different one every time.<br/>
<br/>
So, the shopkeepers mom, she's a healer.<br/>
<br/>
I paid her a visit.<br/>
<br/>
I told you not to talk to anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, boss, but...<br/>
<br/>
only thing is, since I was a kid,<br/>
I've believed in these things.<br/>
<br/>
Look...<br/>
<br/>
I asked her for something to protect you.<br/>
<br/>
The sword of St. Michael the archangel...<br/>
<br/>
-the Virgin--<br/>
-...and the Holy Child of Atocha.<br/>
<br/>
You know my mother and I built a church?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
That's where I grew up, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Limon.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me.<br/>
<br/>
From south Medellin.<br/>
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.<br/>
<br/>
If he does, we'll be listening.<br/>
<br/>
This stays between us, understood?<br/>
<br/>
We will setup a temporary base<br/>
in Casablanca.<br/>
<br/>
We need to act as quickly as possible<br/>
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, Colonel.<br/>
- Good work.<br/>
<br/>
Lieutenant Martinez?<br/>
<br/>
How long since we heard anything<br/>
from Escobar? A month? A month and a half?<br/>
<br/>
A month and a half, sir.<br/>
<br/>
And that whole time you've been<br/>
in the van listening to static?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.<br/>
It's in our blood.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Six.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine what would happen<br/>
if cocaine were legal?<br/>
<br/>
It's your turn.<br/>
<br/>
I think if coke was legal, boss,<br/>
<br/>
you would be the boss of the world<br/>
and the cops couldn't touch you.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
We're sure that the call came from<br/>
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
This is the best intel<br/>
we've received in months.<br/>
<br/>
Don't underestimate him.<br/>
We've made that mistake in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.<br/>
<br/>
If your men are able to find Escobar...<br/>
<br/>
I don't care about the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
I want him d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a problem with that?<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect, Mr. President,<br/>
if he resists, that's how it will go.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.<br/>
<br/>
Keep me informed.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
The attorney general called this morning.<br/>
<br/>
He's decided to end<br/>
your protective custody.<br/>
<br/>
So we have to leave by the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
No. No, you can't do this to us.<br/>
<br/>
They were waiting for your husband<br/>
to turn himself in, and he never did.<br/>
<br/>
Ma<br/>
'em?<br/>
<br/>
May I give you some advice?<br/>
<br/>
I think it's time for you to think<br/>
about you and your children's safety.<br/>
<br/>
Forget about him.<br/>
<br/>
The kids miss you.<br/>
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Probably not a good idea right now,<br/>
my love.<br/>
<br/>
So._. do you fee! a year skier or what?<br/>
<br/>
More like four or five.<br/>
<br/>
We've missed you very much, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
The days feel longer.<br/>
<br/>
For me too.<br/>
<br/>
I still don't understand<br/>
why you're in Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
That place is too dangerous, my love.<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly why.<br/>
No one would think I'd be here.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo...<br/>
<br/>
I think the time has come.<br/>
We don't have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Turning yourself in<br/>
isn't the end of the world, my love.<br/>
<br/>
You can survive prison.<br/>
<br/>
We both know that won't happen.<br/>
<br/>
Stop!<br/>
<br/>
- Listen to me, Pablo...<br/>
- They're talking.<br/>
<br/>
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.<br/>
- Boss.<br/>
<br/>
You will always be that man<br/>
that's admired and followed.<br/>
<br/>
My man.<br/>
<br/>
My love, there's a lot of journalists<br/>
who want to speak with you.<br/>
<br/>
The people love you and follow you.<br/>
<br/>
Tata, Limon wants me off.<br/>
<br/>
It's Escobar. Let's go west!<br/>
Fix the position, Morales.<br/>
<br/>
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.<br/>
<br/>
They put the man in jail,<br/>
but the people still believed in him.<br/>
<br/>
They gave him the Nobel Prize.<br/>
<br/>
They say he may even become president.<br/>
President, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Of the same country that imprisoned him.<br/>
<br/>
I need to hang up.<br/>
We'll talk about this later.<br/>
<br/>
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.<br/>
<br/>
All right, Pablo.<br/>
But think about what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>
R's very important.<br/>
<br/>
It's our only way out really.<br/>
<br/>
Alvaro, let's go slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel! This is Lieutenant Martinez.<br/>
<br/>
Think about turning yourself in, my love.<br/>
Think of your family.<br/>
<br/>
I'll think about it.<br/>
<br/>
All right?<br/>
<br/>
I love you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
To Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
What? No, Hermilda. You can't leave.<br/>
<br/>
My son needs me.<br/>
<br/>
How so?<br/>
<br/>
What you want...<br/>
<br/>
for him to turn himself in<br/>
to those monsters...<br/>
<br/>
I don't want them to k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
They're going to k*ll him either way,<br/>
and you know that.<br/>
<br/>
They won't if he turns himself in.<br/>
<br/>
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!<br/>
- Lower your voice.<br/>
<br/>
No! No, ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
I will not stay quiet<br/>
when I see you betraying my son.<br/>
<br/>
I have never betrayed Pablo.<br/>
Let's make that very clear.<br/>
<br/>
We're locked in this hotel<br/>
as if it were a jail.<br/>
<br/>
We can't even leave the country.<br/>
<br/>
And the only sh*t I have at<br/>
getting my children out of this alive...<br/>
<br/>
is for Pablo to turn himself in.<br/>
<br/>
My son...<br/>
<br/>
needs his mother.<br/>
<br/>
Hermilda.<br/>
<br/>
Please be very careful. Please.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the children...<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell them.<br/>
<br/>
We have intel that Escobar<br/>
is in this building.<br/>
<br/>
Listen up. I want you to do<br/>
what you canto get him alive.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar must be brought to justice<br/>
before the people of Colombia<br/>
<br/>
and answer for the atrocious crimes<br/>
he has committed against this nation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if he resists...<br/>
<br/>
if a single one of our men<br/>
is in harm's way...<br/>
<br/>
I want you to take his life. Understood?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, Colonel!<br/>
- Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Everything all right, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Tata wants me to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.<br/>
<br/>
Nelson Mandela?<br/>
<br/>
Who's that, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Did you buy more rolling papers?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, no, boss.<br/>
<br/>
I can't think with that<br/>
f*cking smell of Chinese food in here.<br/>
<br/>
He's not here.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, come inside.<br/>
You can't risk being seen, sir.<br/>
<br/>
This is my city, Limon.<br/>
<br/>
These are my people.<br/>
<br/>
Medellin will never betray me.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
- We f*cked up again, sir.<br/>
- He's not here.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like your little machine is broken,<br/>
right, Lieutenant?<br/>
<br/>
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Listen up! Take down the staging area<br/>
and head back to Holguin.<br/>
<br/>
The son of a bitch wasn't talking<br/>
from this building, but he was close.<br/>
<br/>
- A ghost.<br/>
- What's that?<br/>
<br/>
That's what you call a signal that's been<br/>
reflected and appears somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
That's what happened with Escobar's<br/>
signal. It bounced off the water.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to get the rolling papers<br/>
and clear my head.<br/>
<br/>
Give me the keys!<br/>
<br/>
- If you want, I'll go.<br/>
- Where are the sunglasses?<br/>
<br/>
- Hello, sir.<br/>
- Hello, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
Can I have a strawberry with cream,<br/>
please?<br/>
<br/>
- My pleasure.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?<br/>
- Just two thousand pesos.<br/>
<br/>
- There you go. Thank you.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.<br/>
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
- My pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
- Kick it here!<br/>
- There you go.<br/>
<br/>
You'd have to be really stupid<br/>
or have a lot of balls<br/>
<br/>
to sit here as if nothing's happening.<br/>
<br/>
They're offering seven million dollars<br/>
for you head,<br/>
<br/>
and you're sitting here<br/>
like a f*cking tourist.<br/>
<br/>
You look just like Che Guevara.<br/>
<br/>
What's beautiful is always beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
You look like you ate Che Guevara.<br/>
<br/>
What? You don't miss me or what?<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that Julius Caesar<br/>
invaded Britain when he was 44?<br/>
<br/>
He lost power many times,<br/>
but always got it back.<br/>
<br/>
Never letting anything stop him.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but that f*ck<br/>
had a f*cking army.<br/>
<br/>
You remember when we used to talk about<br/>
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.<br/>
<br/>
Tata wants me to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.<br/>
She loves you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
You surrender, go to jail<br/>
and take the time to rest, think,<br/>
<br/>
to restructure the business,<br/>
and escape whenever you want.<br/>
<br/>
The legend grows.<br/>
<br/>
- She said the same thing.<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
We both know that things aren't<br/>
going to be as easy as before, cousin.<br/>
<br/>
Let's cut the bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
We are bandits, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
I think...<br/>
<br/>
that everything started to fall apart<br/>
the day you left.<br/>
<br/>
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Every f*cking day of my life, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- I was worried. It's dangerous.<br/>
- Look...<br/>
<br/>
It worked perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
You're a good man, Limon.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot.<br/>
<br/>
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Put salt on it, p*ssy.<br/>
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hungry-<br/>
<br/>
Tata?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
There's the love of my life.<br/>
<br/>
- You sound different.<br/>
- I'm good, my love.<br/>
<br/>
I feel good.<br/>
<br/>
And ready to talk to those reporters.<br/>
<br/>
Good, my love.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean you're turning yourself in?<br/>
<br/>
No, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
H! never surrender.<br/>
<br/>
We won't be under protection, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You have to.<br/>
<br/>
I'll never surrender, my love.<br/>
<br/>
I know, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
But what's your plan?<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
I know what we're going to do.<br/>
<br/>
We will talk to all of those<br/>
foreign journalists.<br/>
<br/>
That's what we are going to do.<br/>
<br/>
-...foreign journalists...<br/>
- Alvaro, slow down!<br/>
<br/>
...so the world will know<br/>
what these bastards are doing...<br/>
<br/>
- It must be around here, Morales.<br/>
- You sure?<br/>
<br/>
We will make the international press<br/>
put pressure on the Colombian government.<br/>
<br/>
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
We will succeed.<br/>
We will fight and we will succeed.<br/>
<br/>
You have to believe me.<br/>
<br/>
- We will succeed.<br/>
- Stop!<br/>
<br/>
As soon as we do that, I'll go<br/>
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
We have to get you and the kids<br/>
out of the country.<br/>
<br/>
And listen...<br/>
<br/>
I will not rest until that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I only have one notebook.<br/>
Let me go get it.<br/>
<br/>
The helicopters are triangulating<br/>
that area, correct?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.<br/>
<br/>
- Very well.<br/>
- Excuse me, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.<br/>
<br/>
All right, excuse me. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead, Lieutenant.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel, I found him.<br/>
<br/>
Who? Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
He's in ms Olivos.<br/>
<br/>
Son, are you sure?<br/>

we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

PABLO ESCOBAR PRESIDENT

Thank you.

How are you, Mr. President?

Thank you.

Thank you.

Much appreciated.

Thank you.

Please come in, Mr. President.

- All yours.
- Thank you.

Happy birthday to you

- Happy birthday to you
- What's this?

Happy birthday, dear Pablo

Happy birthday to you

Bravo, Pablito!

I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.

Don't forget to blow out the candles,
Dad.

Happy birthday, Daddy!

Pablo, we miss you so much.

We wish we could be there with you.

I know, my love.

Soon this will all be behind us.

I promise.

Good morning, boss.

I made some eggs.

- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

Thanks.

I got everything we need, boss.

You went to a different store, correct?

Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

So, the shopkeepers mom, she's a healer.

I paid her a visit.

I told you not to talk to anybody.

Yeah, boss, but...

only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

Look...

I asked her for something to protect you.

The sword of St. Michael the archangel...

-the Virgin--
-...and the Holy Child of Atocha.

You know my mother and I built a church?

Yes, sir.

In Barrio Pablo Escobar.

That's where I grew up, boss.

Happy birthday, sir.

Thank you, Limon.

Pardon me.

From south Medellin.
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.

If he does, we'll be listening.

This stays between us, understood?

We will setup a temporary base
in Casablanca.

We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

Lieutenant Martinez?

How long since we heard anything
from Escobar? A month? A month and a half?

A month and a half, sir.

And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

Yes. Waiting.

Stubbornness seems to run in my family.
It's in our blood.

Excuse me.

Six.

Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

It's your turn.

I think if coke was legal, boss,

you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

Yes, sir.

We're sure that the call came from
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellin.

This is the best intel
we've received in months.

Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

If your men are able to find Escobar...

I don't care about the consequences.

I want him d*ad.

Do you have a problem with that?

With all due respect, Mr. President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

Keep me informed.

Gentlemen.

Mrs. Escobar?

The attorney general called this morning.

He's decided to end
your protective custody.

So we have to leave by the weekend.

No. No, you can't do this to us.

They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

Ma
'em?

May I give you some advice?

I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

Forget about him.

The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?

Probably not a good idea right now,
my love.

So._. do you fee! a year skier or what?

More like four or five.

We've missed you very much, Pablo.

The days feel longer.

For me too.

I still don't understand
why you're in Medellin.

That place is too dangerous, my love.

That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

Pablo...

I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

You can survive prison.

We both know that won't happen.

Stop!

- Listen to me, Pablo...
- They're talking.

- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

My man.

My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

The people love you and follow you.

Tata, Limon wants me off.

It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

They gave him the Nobel Prize.

They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

Of the same country that imprisoned him.

I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

R's very important.

It's our only way out really.

Alvaro, let's go slowly.

Colonel! This is Lieutenant Martinez.

Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

I'll think about it.

All right?

I love you very much.

Where are you going?

To Medellin.

What? No, Hermilda. You can't leave.

My son needs me.

How so?

What you want...

for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

I don't want them to k*ll him.

They're going to k*ll him either way,
and you know that.

They won't if he turns himself in.

- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

No! No, ma'am.

I will not stay quiet
when I see you betraying my son.

I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

We can't even leave the country.

And the only sh*t I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

is for Pablo to turn himself in.

My son...

needs his mother.

Hermilda.

Please be very careful. Please.

Tell the children...

I'll tell them.

We have intel that Escobar
is in this building.

Listen up. I want you to do
what you canto get him alive.

Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

Now, if he resists...

if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

I want you to take his life. Understood?

- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

Everything all right, boss?

Tata wants me to surrender.

She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

Nelson Mandela?

Who's that, boss?

Did you buy more rolling papers?

Sorry, no, boss.

I can't think with that
f*cking smell of Chinese food in here.

He's not here.

Boss, come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

This is my city, Limon.

These are my people.

Medellin will never betray me.

Colonel.

- We f*cked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

Looks like your little machine is broken,
right, Lieutenant?

Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

Excuse me, Colonel.

Listen up! Take down the staging area
and head back to Holguin.

The son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

- A ghost.
- What's that?

That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

Give me the keys!

- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

Sir.

- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

- Kick it here!
- There you go.

You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

to sit here as if nothing's happening.

They're offering seven million dollars
for you head,

and you're sitting here
like a f*cking tourist.

You look just like Che Guevara.

What's beautiful is always beautiful.

You look like you ate Che Guevara.

What? You don't miss me or what?

Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

Thank you, Gustavo.

Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

Never letting anything stop him.

Yeah, but that f*ck
had a f*cking army.

You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.

Tata wants me to surrender.

Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

Maybe it's a good idea.

You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

The legend grows.

- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

Let's cut the bullshit.

We are bandits, Pablo.

Right?

What do you think?

I think...

that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

Every f*cking day of my life, brother.

Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

It worked perfectly.

You're a good man, Limon.

Thank you.

Thanks a lot.

- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

- Put salt on it, p*ssy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

I'm hungry-

Tata?

Pablo?

There's the love of my life.

- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

I feel good.

And ready to talk to those reporters.

Good, my love.

Does that mean you're turning yourself in?

No, Tata.

H! never surrender.

We won't be under protection, Pablo.

You have to.

I'll never surrender, my love.

I know, Pablo.

But what's your plan?

All right.

I know what we're going to do.

We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

That's what we are going to do.

-...foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

You have to believe me.

- We will succeed.
- Stop!

As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

And listen...

I will not rest until that happens.

Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

All right, excuse me. Thank you.

Go ahead, Lieutenant.

Colonel, I found him.

Who? Escobar?

Yes, Colonel.

He's in ms Olivos.

Son, are you sure?

We can't afford the luxury
of making another mistake.

I'm sure. I saw him.

What do you mean you saw him?

Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

And did he see you?

No, I don't think so.

Listen up, Lieutenant.

There's still some men
in the staging area.

I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

Copy that, Colonel.

One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

- Fix the position.
- Right away.

Hello, Dad.

How's it going, son?

You wanted to ask me something or what?

Yes, sir.

What wish did you make for your birthday?

If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

Tell me! Don't be like that!

Well, the only thing that I can tell you

is that it was a very good wish.

You know,

you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

in the back, and I'll take the front.

Get your mom on the phone, okay?

- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

""How do you feel after
all u! these days on the run?“

Write this down.

""It's been very hard
being far from my family,

who I love more than anything
in the world.""

Where do we send it?<br/>
<br/>
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution<br/>
to your great cause<br/>
<br/>
against the communists in the jungle.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you'll find its value<br/>
can be put to good use.<br/>
<br/>
And what do we do about Judy?<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you think is best.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Fidel. Gilberto said<br/>
we can keep all of it.<br/>
<br/>
What? I thought we were going home.<br/>
We don't know anything about cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
We'll learn.<br/>
<br/>
If they can, why not us?<br/>
<br/>
And what about Judy?<br/>
<br/>
Judy feels Medellin<br/>
is only big enough for one narco.<br/>
<br/>
We'll let the Castanos decide which one.<br/>
<br/>
- Fabian.<br/>
- Yes'?<br/>
<br/>
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.<br/>
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.<br/>
<br/>
Hurry up, Berna.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, Judy.<br/>
That meeting can't start without you.<br/>
<br/>
How many people do we have<br/>
in the laboratories?<br/>
<br/>
Forty-five in each one.<br/>
- How many supervisors?<br/>
<br/>
Three in each.<br/>
<br/>
- We need twice as many shifts.<br/>
- Yes, ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.<br/>
The boss is leaving.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Pena.<br/>
- Javier.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you want?<br/>
Something happened, we need to talk.<br/>
<br/>
I'm busy. I can't talk.<br/>
<br/>
There's been an attempt on Judy.<br/>
<br/>
She's saying a few things<br/>
you might want to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Give me time.<br/>
<br/>
- Pena.<br/>
- Mr. Pena has arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go. Search.<br/>
<br/>
Kiko and I built all of this together.<br/>
This is all that is left for me.<br/>
<br/>
What are the Castanos thinking?<br/>
That they can chase me out?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not leaving.<br/>
<br/>
They don't want you to leave,<br/>
they want to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
And what about you?<br/>
You're in this with me too.<br/>
<br/>
Look... you brought these guys here.<br/>
You got in bed with Cali.<br/>
<br/>
This is all your doing.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fight between narcos.<br/>
It's not my problem.<br/>
<br/>
Don't call me again.<br/>
<br/>
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified<br/>
intelligence is a federal offense.<br/>
<br/>
Especially when it ends up<br/>
in the hands of a death squad<br/>
<br/>
that's k*ll innocent people.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some newspaper in America might<br/>
be interested in hearing more about that.<br/>
<br/>
Are you thr*at me?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm thr*at you.<br/>
<br/>
You gotta be f*cking kidding me.<br/>
<br/>
What do you want?<br/>
<br/>
You're a cop.<br/>
<br/>
You know perfectly well<br/>
where Montecasino is.<br/>
<br/>
Where the Castanos are,<br/>
and the Rodriguez’s'.<br/>
<br/>
Arrest them.<br/>
<br/>
And when you do,<br/>
accidentally sh**t them in the head.<br/>
<br/>
- It doesn't work that way-<br/>
- Oh, no? Then how?<br/>
<br/>
We'll do it my way.<br/>
<br/>
So you want Judy to be a rat?<br/>
<br/>
I don't agree with this, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
We are narcos, but we have our honor.<br/>
<br/>
Berna... you're a f*cking drug dealer<br/>
who sells poison by the kilo.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck your honor.<br/>
<br/>
Says you.<br/>
<br/>
You've been happily working<br/>
with the information we've provided.<br/>
<br/>
And what have you done?<br/>
<br/>
If you have a better idea, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, this is the deal.<br/>
<br/>
Judy becomes a confidential informant<br/>
to the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like it,<br/>
you can take on the Castanos alone.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't heard anything from him<br/>
for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We don't even know where he is.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why you're letting<br/>
De Greiff come here.<br/>
<br/>
He's coming to scare you.<br/>
<br/>
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You don't understand, do you?<br/>
<br/>
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.<br/>
<br/>
If they take our protection away,<br/>
we can't do anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo has many properties.<br/>
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
You think someone<br/>
is going to invest in us?<br/>
<br/>
They're going to give us their money?<br/>
<br/>
No one is going to help us.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows what that would mean.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever he's doing...<br/>
<br/>
wherever my son is,<br/>
he's doing it for his family.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget that.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo? Can you hear me, Pablo?<br/>
Please answer.<br/>
<br/>
Tata, can you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Tata?<br/>
<br/>
Can you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
That's a lot of product for men<br/>
who don't know how to run this business.<br/>
<br/>
We have to be clear with them.<br/>
Their work isn't done.<br/>
<br/>
Our donation to them is an advance.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, we have to keep them happy.<br/>
<br/>
Their connection with the Americans<br/>
is invaluable, brother.<br/>
<br/>
What a f*cking joke,<br/>
<br/>
the CIA and their w*r<br/>
against the communists.<br/>
<br/>
It's a joke, but that friendship<br/>
could save our lives one day.<br/>
<br/>
What? Any news about Judy?<br/>
<br/>
The Castanos took their first sh*t,<br/>
a b*mb. But they didn't k*ll her.<br/>
<br/>
Since when did it get so f*cking hard<br/>
to k*ll someone?<br/>
<br/>
What about her assistant?<br/>
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?<br/>
<br/>
He's the one we should k*ll.<br/>
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Don Berna. Him we found.<br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
<br/>
Here.<br/>
<br/>
Out front.<br/>
<br/>
Don Berna!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Gilbert, thank you, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about it.<br/>
I'm hereto speak to you all.<br/>
<br/>
Very well, brother.<br/>
<br/>
It's about Judy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. You won't regret it.<br/>
<br/>
Tata, are you there? Can you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Tata, are you there?<br/>
<br/>
There's no signal here.<br/>
I don't know why you keep trying.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you come drink with us?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right there.<br/>
<br/>
There's coffee in the Thermos.<br/>
<br/>
He's communicating to his wife via radio.<br/>
<br/>
What do you want, Luge'! Money'? 'Asa'?<br/>
<br/>
No visa, no money, you understand?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what he thinks? That everyone<br/>
wants to go to the United States?<br/>
<br/>
I don't want anything.<br/>
<br/>
All I want is for this to end soon and you<br/>
to understand the family is in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Find him and k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
You don't know how to tie a knot.<br/>
<br/>
This is a cowboy's knot.<br/>
This is really good.<br/>

The kids would love to be here.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking...<br/>
<br/>
I could buy some land here next to you.<br/>
<br/>
Some cows, maybe some sheep.<br/>
<br/>
And have my own farm.<br/>
<br/>
We could run it together.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
We need to finish putting up the wire.<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember when the soldiers<br/>
came to our village?<br/>
<br/>
You were a tough little boy,<br/>
probably only seven or eight years old.<br/>
<br/>
But even in that moment,<br/>
you were already the man of the house.<br/>
<br/>
In the face of all that<br/>
v*olence and death, you were strong.<br/>
<br/>
You are a survivor.<br/>
<br/>
A man of action.<br/>
<br/>
I knew that day you were destined<br/>
for great things, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Good evening.<br/>
- Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Sit.<br/>
<br/>
So, did you decipher those codes?<br/>
Are they real?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.<br/>
<br/>
The codes are the same ones<br/>
that Escobar's wife is using.<br/>
<br/>
- He'll use them when he calls her.<br/>
- Did you confirm ifs Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear him?<br/>
<br/>
No, Colonel, not yet.<br/>
<br/>
Why didn't you answer me when I asked<br/>
about me coming here with my family?<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't paying that much attention.<br/>
<br/>
But you're paying attention to me now,<br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
- It's a nice idea.<br/>
- Yes, it's a nice idea.<br/>
<br/>
It's a nice idea, now help me.<br/>
Put that bucket down here.<br/>
<br/>
Now hold on to the pig.<br/>
<br/>
Funny that you don't like blood.<br/>
<br/>
How strange.<br/>
<br/>
What are you trying to say?<br/>
<br/>
Clean yourself.<br/>
<br/>
You know what's funny?<br/>
<br/>
That my dad...<br/>
<br/>
has no f*cking idea who I am.<br/>
<br/>
I know very well who you are.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that I was<br/>
one of the world's richest men?<br/>
<br/>
Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
You know the President<br/>
of the United States knows who I am'?<br/>
<br/>
The United States? Disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
I was elected to the<br/>
House of Representatives of this country.<br/>
<br/>
Your last name is known throughout<br/>
the whole world because of what I did.<br/>
<br/>
- So what? So what?<br/>
- So what'?!<br/>
<br/>
And what about you? What about you?!<br/>
<br/>
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.<br/>
<br/>
On this sh*thole farm.<br/>
<br/>
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.<br/>
<br/>
Not even one f*cking picture of them here.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm nothing more than<br/>
an ignorant old man?<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
Now tell me...<br/>
<br/>
Tell me...<br/>
<br/>
what you think of me.<br/>
<br/>
- Who cares?<br/>
- I do.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to me.<br/>
<br/>
You wanted to come live on this farm<br/>
with your wife and kids.<br/>
<br/>
But that's not possible, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You chose your life!<br/>
<br/>
Be in charge of it.<br/>
<br/>
You want me to tell you<br/>
what I think of you'?<br/>
<br/>
I'm ashamed.<br/>
<br/>
I think you're a m*rder.<br/>
<br/>
At last, the truth.<br/>
<br/>
At last, the truth.<br/>
<br/>
A truth...<br/>
<br/>
that breaks my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Leave me alone.<br/>
<br/>
Limon.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir?<br/>
<br/>
You like it here, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.<br/>
<br/>
Peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Kneel down.<br/>
<br/>
A few kilometers from here, in a field,<br/>
you will find a big tree.<br/>
<br/>
Under that tree is a buried case of money.<br/>
<br/>
Go get it.<br/>
<br/>
Are we leaving, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Go on.<br/>
<br/>
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
How long did you think this arrangement<br/>
was going to last?<br/>
<br/>
Do you not realize that if we leave here,<br/>
they're going to k*ll us?<br/>
<br/>
If you desire, you have the right<br/>
to contract private security services.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.<br/>
<br/>
That is not our problem.<br/>
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
'(WK<br/>
“You`re sorry<br/>
<br/>
Then help us find asylum<br/>
in another country.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have an issue with you<br/>
leaving Colombia. But--<br/>
<br/>
But you can't help us find asylum.<br/>
<br/>
That's bullshit!<br/>
<br/>
They're going to... k*ll us all.<br/>
<br/>
Mama, what's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing, my love.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Attorney General...<br/>
<br/>
but I don't know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
If you're in contact with your husband,<br/>
I advise you to express your concern.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
The power of the law is your last hope.<br/>
<br/>
Think about your children.<br/>
<br/>
Shit.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, before you go to sleep.<br/>
Do you like it? Yes?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Jhon. What are you doing here?<br/>
<br/>
Where is the money?<br/>
The money we gave you. I need it back.<br/>
<br/>
We spent it. It's gone.<br/>
<br/>
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.<br/>
<br/>
You've already hurt me.<br/>
<br/>
You f*cked up my life.<br/>
<br/>
I want to put the baby in her crib.<br/>
Can I put her down?<br/>
<br/>
Hang on, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
And this?<br/>
<br/>
That's all we have, Jhon.<br/>
It's all we have. We need it.<br/>
<br/>
Please, don't take it. Please.<br/>
It's for the baby, please!<br/>
<br/>
You lying... bitch! Get off!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck! Bastard!<br/>
<br/>
I should turn you in for the reward!<br/>
You deserve it!<br/>
<br/>
Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What did you say?<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to say something?<br/>
Are you going to rat on me?<br/>
<br/>
I might! Why shouldn't I?<br/>
<br/>
What? So now you're a k*ll?<br/>
Like your hero?<br/>
<br/>
Jhon!<br/>
<br/>
I know you! Get that shit out--<br/>
<br/>
- Boss, I did what you asked.<br/>
- Show me.<br/>
<br/>
But I have bad news.<br/>
<br/>
- What happened?<br/>
- Look.<br/>
<br/>
It's rotten, sir.<br/>
<br/>
There was half a million dollars<br/>
in that f*cking case.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I could retrieve, sir.<br/>
<br/>
There's about six thousand dollars<br/>
I counted, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Get your things. We're leaving.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, you and I<br/>
are partners in all this.<br/>
<br/>
Everything's set.<br/>
We have to do this tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
<br/>
It's a safe house in El Poblado.<br/>
<br/>
We've used it before.<br/>
<br/>
Berna knows where.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you there.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, Flaco.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you're thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I'm making a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be taken care of<br/>
like you've taken care of me.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that needs to happen<br/>
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Up here, Flaco.<br/>
<br/>
I can't protect a rat.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think you'd betray me.<br/>
<br/>
You were going to get yourself k*ll,<br/>
Judy.<br/>
<br/>
So now, you're going to get on that plane.<br/>
<br/>
And if I don't, what? What happens?<br/>
<br/>
If you don't get in,<br/>
then you'll leave with the Castanos.<br/>
<br/>
And I won't protect you anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me something.<br/>
<br/>
Did Cali arrange this?<br/>
<br/>
How much did they offer you?<br/>
At least tell me that.<br/>
<br/>
It's a mutual understanding.<br/>
I'll work with the Castanos.<br/>
<br/>
They don't understand our business,<br/>
but they'll be useful in mine.<br/>
<br/>
- So you f*cked over your partner.<br/>
- I was never your partner.<br/>
<br/>
I only protected your life.<br/>
<br/>
Relax. You'll have money.<br/>
<br/>
The Americans said they'd make sure<br/>
you had everything you need.<br/>
<br/>
- Where am I going?<br/>
- Doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
Go. And never come back to Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about a thing.<br/>
<br/>
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,<br/>
instead of the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Tata?<br/>
<br/>
Tata, can you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
It's me, my love.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.<br/>
<br/>
I've missed you so much.<br/>
<br/>
Where have you been, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
I had to do something very important.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm back home, my love.<br/>
<br/>
I'm home.</div>]","Here to the right.

Stop.

Stay here.

Who's there?

Relax, sir. We come in peace.

Stay right there!

Relax.

How are the cows?

The cops came here... a few months ago.

What did you tell them?

The truth.

That I haven't seen you in years.

You've gotten old, Pablo.

It happens.

You look younger.

That happens.

Life in the country keeps you young.

Be careful, it's hot.

What's your name?

Limon, sir.

Don't give me that shit.
Whats your real name?

- Jhon.
- Jhon.

Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

All right, gentlemen.

I get up at 5:00 a.m.

Good night.

Good night, Dad.

It is the state, not individuals,
that has justice in its hands

and the legitimacy to use arms.

Gilberto`s no longer our partner.
I don't care what he thinks.

Have you seen the news?

They issued a statement without us.

Los Pepes is done.

That's only for show.
The Castanos are still in Medellin.

No one told me anything.

Listen to me, Berna.

If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll k*ll him ourselves.

We don't need anybody else.

Start moving this product now.

That's all fine, Judy.

But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

Did you know they're offering
$1.4 billion for Los Pepes'?

I know where they are.

Be careful what you say.

That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

I'm not interested in the reward.

I'm interested in my labs.

Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

Sir?

Hello.

And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

This place is full of product.

What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

against the communists in the jungle.

I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

And what do we do about Judy?

Do whatever you think is best.

Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

We'll learn.

If they can, why not us?

And what about Judy?

Judy feels Medellin
is only big enough for one narco.

We'll let the Castanos decide which one.

- Fabian.
- Yes'?

- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

Hurry up, Berna.

Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

Three in each.

- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

Yes, sir.

- Pena.
- Javier.

- What do you want?
Something happened, we need to talk.

I'm busy. I can't talk.

There's been an attempt on Judy.

She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

Give me time.

- Pena.
- Mr. Pena has arrived.

Let's go. Search.

Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

What are the Castanos thinking?
That they can chase me out?

I'm not leaving.

They don't want you to leave,
they want to k*ll you.

And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

This is all your doing.

This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

Don't call me again.

Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

that's k*ll innocent people.

I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

Are you thr*at me?

Yes, I'm thr*at you.

You gotta be f*cking kidding me.

What do you want?

You're a cop.

You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

Where the Castanos are,
and the Rodriguez’s'.

Arrest them.

And when you do,
accidentally sh**t them in the head.

- It doesn't work that way-
- Oh, no? Then how?

We'll do it my way.

So you want Judy to be a rat?

I don't agree with this, Javier.

We are narcos, but we have our honor.

Berna... you're a f*cking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

f*ck your honor.

Says you.

You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

And what have you done?

If you have a better idea, go for it.

Otherwise, this is the deal.

Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castanos alone.

We haven't heard anything from him
for weeks.

We don't even know where he is.

I don't know why you're letting
De Greiff come here.

He's coming to scare you.

And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

You don't understand, do you?

We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

You think someone
is going to invest in us?

They're going to give us their money?

No one is going to help us.

Everyone knows what that would mean.

Whatever he's doing...

wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

Don't forget that.

Pablo? Can you hear me, Pablo?
Please answer.

Tata, can you hear me?

Tata?

Can you hear me?

That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

Our donation to them is an advance.

Besides, we have to keep them happy.

Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

What a f*cking joke,

the CIA and their w*r
against the communists.

It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

What? Any news about Judy?

The Castanos took their first sh*t,
a b*mb. But they didn't k*ll her.

Since when did it get so f*cking hard
to k*ll someone?

What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

He's the one we should k*ll.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

Don Berna. Him we found.

Where?

Here.

Out front.

Don Berna!

Welcome to Cali.

Gilbert, thank you, brother.

Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

Don't worry about it.
I'm hereto speak to you all.

Very well, brother.

It's about Judy.

Thanks. You won't regret it.

Tata, are you there? Can you hear me?

Tata, are you there?

There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

Why don't you come drink with us?

I'll be right there.

There's coffee in the Thermos.

He's communicating to his wife via radio.

What do you want, Luge'! Money'? 'Asa'?

No visa, no money, you understand?

Is that what he thinks? That everyone
wants to go to the United States?

I don't want anything.

All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

Find him and k*ll him.

What are you doing, Pablo?

You don't know how to tie a knot.

This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

Wanted. Pablo Escobar.
Reward."" 2, 700, 000,000 pesos.

Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.

In Bogota', 22-50-12.
In Medellin 61-11-11.

The kids would love to be here.

I've been thinking...

I could buy some land here next to you.

Some cows, maybe some sheep.

And have my own farm.

We could run it together.

What do you think?

We need to finish putting up the wire.

Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

In the face of all that
v*olence and death, you were strong.

You are a survivor.

A man of action.

I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

- Good evening.
- Colonel.

Sit.

So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

The codes are the same ones
that Escobar's wife is using.

- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm ifs Escobar?

Did you hear him?

No, Colonel, not yet.

Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

I wasn't paying that much attention.

But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

So, what do you think?

- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

Now hold on to the pig.

Funny that you don't like blood.

How strange.

What are you trying to say?

Clean yourself.

You know what's funny?

That my dad...

has no f*cking idea who I am.

I know very well who you are.

Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

Is that right?

You know the President
of the United States knows who I am'?

The United States? Disgusting.

I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

- So what? So what?
- So what'?!

And what about you? What about you?!

Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

On this sh*thole farm.

Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

Not even one f*cking picture of them here.

So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

That's right.

Now tell me...

Tell me...

what you think of me.

- Who cares?
- I do.

It's important to me.

You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

But that's not possible, Pablo.

You chose your life!

Be in charge of it.

You want me to tell you
what I think of you'?

I'm ashamed.

I think you're a m*rder.

At last, the truth.

At last, the truth.

A truth...

that breaks my heart.

Leave me alone.

Limon.

Yes, sir?

You like it here, right?

Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

Peaceful.

Kneel down.

A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

Under that tree is a buried case of money.

Go get it.

Are we leaving, boss?

Yes.

Go on.

That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

Do you not realize that if we leave here,
they're going to k*ll us?

If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

'(WK
“You`re sorry

Then help us find asylum
in another country.

I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But--

But you can't help us find asylum.

That's bullshit!

They're going to... k*ll us all.

Mama, what's wrong?

Nothing, my love.

I'm sorry, Attorney General...

but I don't know what else to do.

If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

Tell him to surrender.

The power of the law is your last hope.

Think about your children.

Shit.

Yes, before you go to sleep.
Do you like it? Yes?

f*ck.

Jhon. What are you doing here?

Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

We spent it. It's gone.

Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

You've already hurt me.

You f*cked up my life.

I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

Hang on, Maritza.

And this?

That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

You lying... bitch! Get off!

f*ck! Bastard!

I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.

What did you say?

Are you going to say something?
Are you going to rat on me?

I might! Why shouldn't I?

What? So now you're a k*ll?
Like your hero?

Jhon!

I know you! Get that shit out--

- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

But I have bad news.

- What happened?
- Look.

It's rotten, sir.

There was half a million dollars
in that f*cking case.

This is what I could retrieve, sir.

There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

Get your things. We're leaving.

Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

Where?

It's a safe house in El Poblado.

We've used it before.

Berna knows where.

I'll see you there.

Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

Let's go, Flaco.

I know what you're thinking.

I'm making a mistake.

You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

Up here, Flaco.

I can't protect a rat.

I didn't think you'd betray me.

You were going to get yourself k*ll,
Judy.

So now, you're going to get on that plane.

And if I don't, what? What happens?

If you don't get in,
then you'll leave with the Castanos.

And I won't protect you anymore.

Tell me something.

Did Cali arrange this?

How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castanos.

They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

- So you f*cked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

I only protected your life.

Relax. You'll have money.

The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

Go. And never come back to Colombia.

Don't worry about a thing.

You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

Tata?

Tata, can you hear me?

Pablo?

It's me, my love.

Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

I've missed you so much.

Where have you been, Pablo?

I had to do something very important.

But I'm back home, my love.

I'm home."

<br/>
Children and innocent people<br/>

<br/>
That was an act of pure terrorism.<br/>
It must be answered for.<br/>

What kind of country is it<br/>
when a death squad is not only tolerated<br/>
<br/>
but is actually sanctioned<br/>

<br/>
Do you want to see Bogota'<br/>
turned into a crater'?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what it will take to protect<br/>
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?<br/>
<br/>
No. Your family's safety<br/>
is our utmost concern.<br/>
<br/>
They're simply... in protective custody.<br/>
<br/>
Get my family out of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
We can get your family out of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
But I can't guarantee any country<br/>
will accept them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have that kind of power.<br/>
<br/>
You better find that kind of power,<br/>
<br/>
because I won't even discuss surrender<br/>
until my family is out of the country.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.<br/>

Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.<br/>

And Escobar's family? Should we get them?<br/>
<br/>
No, not now. They're surrounded by police.<br/>

They're not going anywhere.<br/>

Not much longer, love. Keep eating.<br/>

WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR; IN DEFENSE<br/>
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES<br/>
<br/>
- Hector.<br/>
- Sir.<br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor and bring Miss Judy a beer.<br/>
<br/>
- Of course, boss.<br/>
- Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't about Pablo.<br/>
Pablo is a d*ad man.<br/>
<br/>
It's just a matter of time.<br/>
We're here to talk about the future.<br/>
<br/>
And if you're interested in the future,<br/>
then you'll have to join us.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Judy,<br/>
you know we never had problems with Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, we had a very good relationship<br/>
with Kiko. Right, Berna?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
- And that's why we made the decision<br/>
<br/>
to stay out of this shit.<br/>
<br/>
And that has been a good decision<br/>
for business as well?<br/>
<br/>
Because things are very difficult.<br/>
<br/>
And when all this shit is over,<br/>
the organization will change,<br/>
<br/>
the routes will change,<br/>
this whole city will change.<br/>
<br/>
And how do you know<br/>
you'll still be in business, Judy?<br/>
<br/>
That's why I'm talking to you.<br/>
<br/>
If all of us from Medellin are united,<br/>
<br/>
we'll be able to say<br/>
what happens to each one of us.<br/>
<br/>
Meet me at Montecasino<br/>
with our associates,<br/>
<br/>
and you tell them you're on our side.<br/>
<br/>
She wants them to join Los Pepes.<br/>
<br/>
They say Pablo Escobar is f*cked,<br/>
that his time has come.<br/>
<br/>
And that they have to decide<br/>
whose side they're on.<br/>
<br/>
- What did they say?<br/>
- They're joining.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the information.<br/>
<br/>
They have a meeting<br/>
with the Castanos on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
This is big, boss.<br/>
<br/>
If the Gallons are with them,<br/>
maybe some of the other guys are too.<br/>
<br/>
When is it?<br/>
<br/>
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.<br/>
<br/>
Take that address...<br/>
<br/>
and go to Montecasino.<br/>
<br/>
Take Limon with you.<br/>
<br/>
And find out what's going on over there.<br/>
<br/>
Quica.<br/>
<br/>
Are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
How many men can we rely on?<br/>
<br/>
I think I can round up a hundred.<br/>
But we need cash.<br/>
<br/>
How much money do we have on hand?<br/>
<br/>
If we collect all the money in<br/>
the stash houses, that should be enough.<br/>
<br/>
It's... around this much.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment<br/>
from Miami.<br/>
<br/>
But it's harder than ever<br/>
to get it through.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure we have the w*apon and the men<br/>
we need when the time comes. Got it?<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that matters now is getting<br/>
Tata and the children out of the country.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can take care of business.<br/>
<br/>
Go on.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Pass that to me.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing relevant has happened today.<br/>
<br/>
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.<br/>
Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
You don't like it, go work at CNN.<br/>
<br/>
- Miss Velez.<br/>
- Yes, honey?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for interrupting,<br/>
but you have a call--<br/>
<br/>
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.<br/>
She says it's urgent.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing? Answer the call.<br/>
<br/>
You have to get her<br/>
to give you an interview.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
I know that you and I have had<br/>
a lot of problems in the past.<br/>
<br/>
But I need you to help me.<br/>
<br/>
I brought all the influence<br/>
the party can bear on Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
And it seems he has agreed<br/>
to find asylum for your family.<br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
<br/>
No, that remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
But we will meet in his office,<br/>
<br/>
I suppose to discuss the terms<br/>
of their relocation.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- You're a man of your word.<br/>
- I am.<br/>
<br/>
Now you must be of your word.<br/>
<br/>
I will. Be sure of that.<br/>
<br/>
The moment my family is safe,<br/>
we will speak again.<br/>
<br/>
- Until then.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
She's here.<br/>
<br/>
Bring her here.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
I liked it more with the hood on.<br/>
<br/>
I told them, don't take me anywhere<br/>
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.<br/>
<br/>
It's very dangerous<br/>
to be my friend these days.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Look. These are the codes for the radio.<br/>
I'll put them here.<br/>
<br/>
And here is some cash.<br/>
<br/>
This is for you.<br/>
<br/>
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.<br/>
- It's for your help.<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing this for you.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm worried about you, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You guys can't do shit to me.<br/>
<br/>
De Greiff offered us amnesty.<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
But you have to talk to get it.<br/>
<br/>
You want to negotiate, gringo?<br/>
<br/>
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
I'll give you something. Something small.<br/>
<br/>
Blackie...<br/>
<br/>
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.<br/>
<br/>
What name did your mother give you?<br/>
<br/>
Nelson Hernandez... Lucumi.<br/>
<br/>
Lucumi?<br/>
<br/>
From the Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
Lucumi, they found expl*sive residue<br/>
on your hands.<br/>
<br/>
On your jacket, everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
They're going to blame you<br/>
for that b*mb, Lucumi.<br/>
<br/>
Hey...<br/>
<br/>
- I had nothing to do with it.<br/>
- We know that.<br/>
<br/>
We know it wasn't your idea.<br/>
We know you're not the boss.<br/>
<br/>
Don't let them blame you for this.<br/>
<br/>
Don't let them see you as the one<br/>
who k*ll all those innocent children.<br/>
<br/>
Help us and we'll help you.<br/>
<br/>
Give us Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
No f*cking way. I can't give you Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
No f*cking way I give you the boss.<br/>
<br/>
Then give us something.<br/>
<br/>
You have to give us something<br/>
or they'll hang you.<br/>
<br/>
I'll give you...<br/>
<br/>
La Quica.<br/>
<br/>
f*g.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of them.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think we can take all of them?<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong, brother?<br/>
<br/>
You're turning into a p*ssy.<br/>
<br/>
If you're scared, why don't you run away?<br/>
<br/>
Abandon the boss.<br/>
It's that easy, brother.<br/>
<br/>
No, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I'm loyal to the boss.<br/>
<br/>
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.<br/>
<br/>
You better, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Trujillo.<br/>
- Yes, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare the emergency team.<br/>
<br/>
They need to be ready<br/>
when we get the signal.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, Colonel.<br/>
Martinez, get your people ready.<br/>
<br/>
We'll start tracking them<br/>
first thing tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
At your service, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Good work on Blackie.<br/>
<br/>
I need to know you didn't make the call.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I want<br/>
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
It's the only thing I want, Pena.<br/>
<br/>
- For all the lives he has taken.<br/>
- I know.<br/>
<br/>
But not with them.<br/>
<br/>
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.<br/>
<br/>
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop<br/>
should be standing over him.<br/>
<br/>
- Good evening, Ms. Velez.<br/>
- Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, they're expecting you.<br/>
<br/>
What is she doing here?<br/>
<br/>
I sent for her.<br/>
<br/>
Please, take the children to their room.<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
This is from Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
It's a radio telephone,<br/>
so you can speak with him.<br/>
<br/>
This is a cipher sheet<br/>
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.<br/>
<br/>
You must keep it hidden.<br/>
<br/>
He also sent you money.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's do the interview already.<br/>
<br/>
You know what? Another time.<br/>
<br/>
When all of this is over.<br/>
<br/>
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.<br/>
I can't leave so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Then stay.<br/>
<br/>
You can show yourself out<br/>
when you're ready.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Tata.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, is it you?<br/>
<br/>
So good to hear your voice, my love.<br/>
<br/>
How are you, Tata?<br/>
<br/>
How are our children?<br/>
<br/>
My love, we're all okay.<br/>
<br/>
We need you.<br/>
<br/>
And I need you.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I'm going to get<br/>
you out of there soon.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to the attorney general.<br/>
Everything is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.<br/>
<br/>
I love you very much.<br/>
<br/>
I love you, my darling. I love you...<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President, I ask you<br/>
not to take this as a failure.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar will be brought to justice.<br/>
<br/>
And once his family is out of Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
he will reinitiaie negotiations<br/>
for his surrender.<br/>
<br/>
- I already did that.<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I've got a list here<br/>
<br/>
of possible locations that would be safe<br/>
for the Escobar family.<br/>
<br/>
If you ask officially,<br/>
those countries will allow them to enter.<br/>
<br/>
Attorney General De Greiff...<br/>
<br/>
it seems you've been misinformed.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me?<br/>
<br/>
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.<br/>
<br/>
I am categorically opposed<br/>
to you or anyone else doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what that means?<br/>
<br/>
There will be no surrender.<br/>
<br/>
The v*olence will not end.<br/>
<br/>
And you will be the one responsible.<br/>
<br/>
You... will be the one responsible.<br/>
<br/>
Your promises and negotiations<br/>
have only brought us more v*olence,<br/>
<br/>
while making him stronger.<br/>
<br/>
This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end<br/>
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.<br/>
<br/>
This...<br/>
<br/>
This ends with his death.<br/>
<br/>
Na, you don't need in worry<br/>
about anything.<br/>
<br/>

What's up, little Lion?<br/>
<br/>
Doing good. Just hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
Is everything packed or what?<br/>
<br/>
I don't get why you're staying<br/>
in this dump, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I would have thought that Pacho Herrera<br/>
<br/>
would be staying in a five star hotel<br/>

PABLO'S WHORE<br/>

Are you all okay?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we're okay.<br/>

Everything will end soon. But you need<br/>

Tonight...<br/>

We'll fight with everything we have.<br/>

f*ck the Cali cartel!<br/>

f*ck Judy Moncada!<br/>
<br/>
f*ck Los Castanos!<br/>
<br/>
We're going to show these f*ck<br/>

Bring all the men we can buy.<br/>

Go to Medellin,<br/>
to every money stash we have<br/>

Limon and Quica<br/>

Forgive me.

Children and innocent people
died in that b*mb.

That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

Surrender, unconditionally, now.

What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

but is actually sanctioned
by the g*dd*mn government?

Do you want to see Bogota'
turned into a crater'?

Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

They're simply... in protective custody.

Get my family out of Colombia.

We can get your family out of Colombia.

But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

I don't have that kind of power.

You better find that kind of power,

because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action

and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.

Yesterday's b*mb
has resulted in a total of...

Now he's really f*cked up.

Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.

It's time.

And Escobar's family? Should we get them?

No, not now. They're surrounded by police.

They're not going anywhere.

Son of a bitch.

Stay there. You can go.

- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

- And don't smoke in the room again.
- Yes, sir.

Thank you.

Excuse me.

- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

Come eat something.

- Mama?
- Yes, my love?

Who are Los Pepes?

No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

And how much longer do we have to be here?

Not much longer, love. Keep eating.

Can I speak with you a moment?

- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

We can't even call him.

Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

We're alone, Hermilda.

And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

Excuse me, Colonel...

CARLOS HOLGUIN POLICE BASE

Blackie. What's going on?

- Do you think you can get inside?
- No, boss. I don't think so.

With all the police swarming around,
ifs impossible.

Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

No, I can't. It's too difficult.

Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

Sure, boss.

All right, as soon as you see anything,
call me.

Biackie...

ifs important that I know they're okay.

Hey, boss.

Can you believe it?

Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

What do you see? Is she alone?

She looks beautiful. She's at the window.

She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

The one you like so much.

The children, Blackie. Can you see them?

There, I can see Manuela, boss.

- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

Go.

Blackie...

thanks for this.

WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR; IN DEFENSE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES

- Hector.
- Sir.

Do me a favor and bring Miss Judy a beer.

- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a d*ad man.

It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us.

Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

to stay out of this shit.

And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

Because things are very difficult.

And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

That's why I'm talking to you.

If all of us from Medellin are united,

we'll be able to say
what happens to each one of us.

Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

and you tell them you're on our side.

She wants them to join Los Pepes.

They say Pablo Escobar is f*cked,
that his time has come.

And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

- What did they say?
- They're joining.

Here's the information.

They have a meeting
with the Castanos on Friday.

This is big, boss.

If the Gallons are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too.

When is it?

Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

Take that address...

and go to Montecasino.

Take Limon with you.

And find out what's going on over there.

Quica.

Are you all right?

Yes, boss.

How many men can we rely on?

I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

How much money do we have on hand?

If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

It's... around this much.

I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

Make sure we have the w*apon and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

Then we can take care of business.

Go on.

Yes, sir.

Pass that to me.

Nothing relevant has happened today.

Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

You don't like it, go work at CNN.

- Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call--

Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

What are you doing? Answer the call.

You have to get her
to give you an interview.

Hello?

Hello?

I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

But I need you to help me.

I brought all the influence
the party can bear on Gaviria.

And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

Where?

No, that remains to be seen.

But we will meet in his office,

I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

Thank you, sir.

- You're a man of your word.
- I am.

Now you must be of your word.

I will. Be sure of that.

The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

- Until then.
- Thank you.

She's here.

Bring her here.

Hello, Valeria.

I liked it more with the hood on.

I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

Come on.

Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

And here is some cash.

This is for you.

- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

I'm doing this for you.

Thank you.

I'm worried about you, Pablo.

You guys can't do shit to me.

De Greiff offered us amnesty.

That's right.

But you have to talk to get it.

You want to negotiate, gringo?

You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

I'll give you something. Something small.

Blackie...

Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

What name did your mother give you?

Nelson Hernandez... Lucumi.

Lucumi?

From the Pacific.

Lucumi, they found expl*sive residue
on your hands.

On your jacket, everywhere.

They're going to blame you
for that b*mb, Lucumi.

Hey...

- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

Don't let them blame you for this.

Don't let them see you as the one
who k*ll all those innocent children.

Help us and we'll help you.

Give us Pablo.

No f*cking way. I can't give you Pablo.

No f*cking way I give you the boss.

Then give us something.

You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

I'll give you...

La Quica.

f*g.

There's a lot of them.

Do you think we can take all of them?

What's wrong, brother?

You're turning into a p*ssy.

If you're scared, why don't you run away?

Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

No, brother.

I'm loyal to the boss.

And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

You better, f*ck.

- Trujillo.
- Yes, Colonel.

Prepare the emergency team.

They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

- Yes, Colonel.
Martinez, get your people ready.

We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

At your service, Colonel.

Good work on Blackie.

I need to know you didn't make the call.

The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

It's the only thing I want, Pena.

- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

But not with them.

I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

- Good evening, Ms. Velez.
- Good evening.

Welcome, they're expecting you.

What is she doing here?

I sent for her.

Please, take the children to their room.

Please.

Let's go.

This is from Pablo.

It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

You must keep it hidden.

He also sent you money.

Thank you.

Well, let's do the interview already.

You know what? Another time.

When all of this is over.

I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

Then stay.

You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

Pablo?

Tata.

Pablo, is it you?

So good to hear your voice, my love.

How are you, Tata?

How are our children?

My love, we're all okay.

We need you.

And I need you.

Listen, I'm going to get
you out of there soon.

I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.

Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

I love you very much.

I love you, my darling. I love you...

Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

Escobar will be brought to justice.

And once his family is out of Colombia,

he will reinitiaie negotiations
for his surrender.

- I already did that.
- Yes.

Well, I've got a list here

of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

Attorney General De Greiff...

it seems you've been misinformed.

Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

Pardon me?

I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

Do you know what that means?

There will be no surrender.

The v*olence will not end.

And you will be the one responsible.

You... will be the one responsible.

Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more v*olence,

while making him stronger.

This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

This...

This ends with his death.

Na, you don't need in worry
about anything.

Put yourself at ease. We got it.

Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.

How's it going?

What's up, little Lion?

Doing good. Just hanging out.

Is everything packed or what?

I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

I would have thought that Pacho Herrera

would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles--

- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

I'll take more.

PABLO'S WHORE

So my business is done? Is that right?

I can't get anyone on the phone, sir.

I called many times. Many times.

I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

Pablo!

Pablo, they k*ll her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.

Are you all okay?

Yes, we're okay.

Listen.

I need you to be strong.

Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

I'll cal! you back soon.

I love you very much.

We'll fight with everything we have.

I will always love you, Pablo.

Keep going down that road.
I'll show you the way.

Yes, boss.

<br/>
Good morning, Mom.<br/>
<br/>
- Your cat bit me again.<br/>
- You stole my pencils.<br/>
<br/>
- Why are you fighting?<br/>
- Because he stole my pencils!<br/>
<br/>
- She's making it up.<br/>
- Stop fighting,<br/>
<br/>
- Let's see.<br/>
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?<br/>
<br/>
-6:40 a.m.<br/>
- God, I'm late again.<br/>
<br/>
Remember to ask your brother<br/>
what we talked about.<br/>
<br/>
- Tell him school starts next week.<br/>
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?<br/>
<br/>
I still have to buy the books, everything.<br/>
<br/>
I told you I'll ask him, my love,<br/>
all right?<br/>
<br/>
And you still haven't lied your shoes.<br/>
So, like I taught you, right?<br/>
<br/>
We have the rabbit ear,<br/>
we go around the tree, and...?<br/>
<br/>
And it goes in the hole.<br/>
<br/>
That was a loud one.<br/>
<br/>
LLUIS LODONO WHITE, SERVILE FRONT MAN AND<br/>
INITIATOR OF KIDNAPPINGS FOR PABLO ESCOBAR<br/>
<br/>
Sit him there.<br/>
<br/>
Over here.<br/>
<br/>
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
One... two... and three.<br/>
<br/>
This family is the only thing<br/>
I care about.<br/>
<br/>
- You're the one that--<br/>
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?<br/>
<br/>
- We shouldn't leave, Tata.<br/>
- All of this is your fault.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd listened to Pablo,<br/>
my brother would still be alive.<br/>
<br/>
Because you do that so well?<br/>
Do you listen to him?<br/>
<br/>
When you're always criticizing him,<br/>
doubting him, worrying.<br/>
<br/>
I would never put this family in danger.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her ifs not my fault, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- I know, Mom.<br/>
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
It's not your fault. I know.<br/>
It's not your fault.<br/>
<br/>
Everything's all right, Mom.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't your fault.<br/>
<br/>
Look at these smiling faces.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't want to make you<br/>
uncomfortable, Judy.<br/>
<br/>
How considerate of you.<br/>
So that's why no one called me'!<br/>
<br/>
Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.<br/>
<br/>
So I was supposed to be notified<br/>
when it was taken back.<br/>
<br/>
- That wasn't made clear to us.<br/>
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
- What are we going to do with that?<br/>
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.<br/>
<br/>
That is my cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single<br/>
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellin<br/>
<br/>
until Pablo Escobar is d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.<br/>
<br/>
That's the Cali camel's strategy?<br/>
<br/>
To keep making money<br/>
while the rest of us go hungry?<br/>
<br/>
- You know we can't trust them.<br/>
- No. Not them or any of you.<br/>
<br/>
We don't trust any drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.<br/>
All right?<br/>
<br/>
We all need friends.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, would you like some?<br/>
<br/>
Go!<br/>
<br/>
Sir?<br/>
<br/>
Are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
Are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
- We're done working together.<br/>
- What's bothering you?<br/>
<br/>
The k*ll of innocent civilians,<br/>
for starters.<br/>
<br/>
Whether they're innocent or guilty,<br/>
I don't decide.<br/>
<br/>
That's what priests are for, no?<br/>
<br/>
The Castanos are crazier than ever,<br/>
and that wasn't part of the plan.<br/>
<br/>
But it's working.<br/>
<br/>
Not if I stop providing you intel.<br/>
<br/>
For what ifs worth, lam on your side.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like what's happening.<br/>
<br/>
Medellin is my home<br/>
and I love it very much.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the methods<br/>
of the Castanos go...<br/>
<br/>
well, those are the methods<br/>
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.<br/>
<br/>
Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,<br/>
Fernando Duque.<br/>
<br/>
Our guys fired a whole f*cking clip<br/>
at him, point blank.<br/>
<br/>
Can you believe that these sons of bitches<br/>
didn't hit him once?<br/>
<br/>
I need you to help me find him.<br/>
<br/>
He's Pablo's mouthpiece<br/>
and his connection to the government.<br/>
<br/>
What we want is to exterminate this rat.<br/>
<br/>
That way, we'll get to Pablo<br/>
and we can end this madness, Pena.<br/>
<br/>
I've told you! You have to»<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing?<br/>
You have to bring the passports.<br/>
<br/>
Juliana... they're trying to k*ll me.<br/>
We have to get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
I think you're the one<br/>
who needs to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Can I see Simon, at least?<br/>
<br/>
- Where-- Simon!<br/>
- Slop, Fernando!<br/>
<br/>
Simon is at school.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, this isn't even your week.<br/>
So, please... leave.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, what's going on?<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
<br/>
- Bye, Anda!<br/>
- Bye!<br/>
<br/>
Where's Morn? Why do you have her can'?<br/>
<br/>
Get in.<br/>
<br/>
Come in.<br/>
<br/>
Go on, son. Sit down.<br/>
<br/>
So, you're being reassigned...<br/>
<br/>
and you will be moved into the intel unit<br/>
that was formed a couple of months ago.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be all right there.<br/>
<br/>
You're sending me to an office<br/>
because I made a mistake?<br/>
<br/>
Anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
How are you, Papa?<br/>
<br/>
And you?<br/>
<br/>
- How long will we be there?<br/>
- Not long.<br/>
<br/>
Just long enough for me<br/>
to get some things figured out here.<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember when<br/>
we went to the United States?<br/>
<br/>
It's going to be an adventure,<br/>
just like that.<br/>
<br/>
Do they have Disney World there?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to your mother<br/>
and your grandmother. All right?<br/>
<br/>
I made more than one reservation so<br/>
no one would know what flight you're on.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to Fernando<br/>
and he said it's perfectly legal.<br/>
<br/>
You have every right to leave the country.<br/>
<br/>
- It's like a normal trip.<br/>
- A normal trip?<br/>
<br/>
Confess. Do you regret it?<br/>
<br/>
Marrying me, or what?<br/>
<br/>
Not for a second.<br/>
<br/>
They may separate us...<br/>
<br/>
but they'll never be able to destroy us.<br/>
<br/>
Go.<br/>
<br/>
The little bunny.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take care of him, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Give me a kiss.<br/>
<br/>
Sergeant. Private Hugo Martinez Jr.<br/>
at your service, sir.<br/>
<br/>
The colonel's son.<br/>
<br/>
He said you have some<br/>
technical background.<br/>
<br/>
I took a couple<br/>
of engineering classes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
And I built a ham in my parents' house.<br/>
<br/>
Great. What do you know about RDF?<br/>
<br/>
The basic concept, sir.<br/>
<br/>
The basic concept.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Get acquainted.<br/>
We go out tomorrow afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
And don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Carlos Castano,<br/>
this won't hit back.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
I'm going to freeze to death out here.<br/>
<br/>
That's Bogoté.<br/>
What do you expect?<br/>
<br/>
Hey! What the f*ck is wrong with you?<br/>
Why are you networking?<br/>
<br/>
Get to work.<br/>
I'm not paying you with candy.<br/>
<br/>
- Okay, okay.<br/>
- Pass me the phone, boy.<br/>
<br/>
Make some f*cking b*mb.<br/>
You need an invitation to start working?<br/>
<br/>
Hurry, boy! You get to work too!<br/>
<br/>
And don't smoke near the g*n.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, boss.<br/>
I just came back from the airport.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother<br/>
are on the plane, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Thank the Virgin Mary.<br/>
<br/>
That's the most important thing.<br/>
They're flying now.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing.<br/>
<br/>
We hit those f*cking drugstores<br/>
pretty hard.<br/>
<br/>
You tell us. Should we come home or--<br/>
<br/>
No. Stay put. We're no': dune yet.<br/>
<br/>
I may need you again.<br/>
<br/>
Copy that, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Blackie.<br/>
<br/>
Figure out... what time it is in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
On it, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Boss!<br/>
<br/>
Boss!<br/>
<br/>
Pena.<br/>
<br/>
Any word on our friend?<br/>
<br/>
Did you find him?<br/>
<br/>
- Pena?<br/>
- Not yet.<br/>
<br/>
What's up, Pena?<br/>
<br/>
Are we getting a beer or what?<br/>
<br/>
Another day, brother.<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
No. What are you doing, Simon?<br/>
<br/>
Leave it where it is.<br/>
I'm listening to the news.<br/>
<br/>
What are we doing here?<br/>
<br/>
I told you. We're going on a trip.<br/>
<br/>
And what's happening? Where's my mom?<br/>
<br/>
Simon... calm down.<br/>
I already spoke to your mother.<br/>
<br/>
You got yourself into trouble, didn't you?<br/>
<br/>
Ifs because you work for Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
That's why this is happening.<br/>
<br/>
You're his lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
What are we going to do now?<br/>
<br/>
I have a plan. Calm down.<br/>
<br/>
You don't have a plan, Dad.<br/>
You're a son of a bitch. A f*cking thief.<br/>
<br/>
Did you say ""son of a bitch""? ""Thief""?<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
All of the money this family has,<br/>
we have because I've been a good lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
- I do my job.<br/>
- I want to call my mom.<br/>
<br/>
You want to call your mom?<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to call your mom,<br/>
or do you want to behave like a man?<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to be a p*ssy<br/>
and call your mom? That's a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
Let's call her so she can tell you where<br/>
all the money for your toys came from.<br/>
<br/>
Your room full of toys.<br/>
Where do you think it came from?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't complain during the Christmases<br/>
or the birthdays<br/>
<br/>
or when I bought you a motorcycle.<br/>
<br/>
But now you're complaining. Very well!<br/>
Very well. It's over.<br/>
<br/>
It's over! Now that they're<br/>
going to k*ll me, it's over.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry... Simon.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean to say that.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
Everything will be all right.<br/>
Forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
Was it a heart attack or what?<br/>
<br/>
You fainted, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
How many of those are you taking?<br/>
<br/>
I've had a terrible headache.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren't any good, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn't put so much shit<br/>
in your body.<br/>
<br/>
You're better off... taking these drops.<br/>
They're homeopathic.<br/>
<br/>
Three drops under your tongue<br/>
in the morning and two at night.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever been to Disney World?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't.<br/>
<br/>
It's beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
It's very organized. Very clean.<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?<br/>
<br/>
Stress.<br/>
<br/>
Stress is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
How's the weed working out?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been smoking a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The first man who smoked marijuana<br/>
was a Chinese emperor.<br/>
<br/>
He b*rned the plant because<br/>
he was attracted to its smell.<br/>
<br/>
But when he inhaled the smoke,<br/>
he saw a blue jay.<br/>
<br/>
And the bird told him<br/>
to conquer his neighboring empires.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what he did.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
With you until death, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to stay and stand guard.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see, darling.<br/>
Color inside the lines.<br/>
<br/>
There it is.<br/>
<br/>
This is our stop.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on?<br/>
- What's happening?<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on'?<br/>
- Can you give me back my passport?<br/>
<br/>
That money is ours.<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo, they're not letting us in.<br/>
- No, no! They can't do that.<br/>
<br/>
That's what they're doing.<br/>
<br/>
They can't--<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.<br/>
That's illegal. Don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, because--<br/>
<br/>
Do what you need to do to get us<br/>
into Germany. I have to hang up.<br/>
<br/>
Don't touch me!<br/>
I'm asking you not to touch me.<br/>
<br/>
Let go!<br/>
<br/>
No!<br/>
<br/>
Fernando Duque.<br/>
<br/>
Javier Pena.<br/>
<br/>
It took me one day to find you.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want them to k*ll you,<br/>
you need to start doing things better.<br/>
<br/>
Please... get me out of here.<br/>
<br/>
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know<br/>
who I work for? Who I worked for'?<br/>
<br/>
Well, our help isn't free.<br/>
<br/>
We need full cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
Dad!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Simon, it's all right.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs all right. Go back inside.<br/>
I'll come up soon.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs my son. He's... He's scared.<br/>
<br/>
First, we'll get you to Holguin.<br/>
You’ll be safe--<br/>
<br/>
No! No, we're staying here.<br/>
<br/>
There are cops working<br/>
for Los Pepes everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
It would be better if you get us<br/>
to the United States at once.<br/>
<br/>
I'll cooperate with you.<br/>
Anything you want.<br/>
<br/>
I'll cooperate with you.<br/>
Please get us out of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Is that a deal?<br/>
<br/>
Do as I say.<br/>
<br/>
Start by hiding your f*cking wife's car.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, German embassy.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'll k*ll every last German<br/>
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Then I will b*mb Frankfurt, Munich...<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to shove b*mb up your asses,<br/>
you bastard f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
n*zi, r*cist gonorrheas.<br/>
I'm going to k*ll all of you. You hear?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to k*ll all of you!<br/>
<br/>
I once heard you say that I had the same<br/>
rights as any other Colombian citizen.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that also applies to my family,<br/>
correct?<br/>
<br/>
The government hasn't done anything<br/>
to stop Los Pepes,<br/>
<br/>
those t*rrorists who have attacked<br/>
my family and m*rder my associates.<br/>
<br/>
Is that how the Colombian government<br/>
ensures the rights of all its citizens?<br/>
<br/>
The president is trying to prevent<br/>
my family from entering Germany<br/>
<br/>
and yet you do nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
That man wants to dangle my family before<br/>
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,<br/>
<br/>
and you, who call yourself a man<br/>
of principle, do nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of interference.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Medellin has too many electrical<br/>
wires, phone wires, antennae.<br/>
<br/>
- That must be why.<br/>
- What's your success rate?<br/>
<br/>
To be honest,<br/>
we haven't located a signal yet.<br/>
<br/>
Not one?<br/>
<br/>
Not one.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.<br/>
<br/>
Let's both start here: L9.329..329.<br/>
<br/>
There it is.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to my police contact and<br/>
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
None other than that son of a bitch, Pena.<br/>
What do you think about that?<br/>
<br/>
Who's your contact?<br/>
<br/>
Who he is isn't important.<br/>
The important thing is that I trust him.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what<br/>
the worst part of this is?<br/>
<br/>
We can no longer trust Pena.<br/>
<br/>
Then we'll have to put a b*llet in him.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
We can't k*ll DEA agents.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no? Why not?<br/>
<br/>
If it were up to me,<br/>
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.<br/>
<br/>
Berna, look...<br/>
<br/>
Schedule a meeting with Pena,<br/>
just as you have been.<br/>
<br/>
We'll take care of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES<br/>
<br/>
Cordoba recovers,<br/>
we'll have a goalie in place.<br/>
<br/>
Leonel Alvarez can do his thing<br/>
and move the ball along.<br/>
<br/>
Did you follow me to the hotel?<br/>
You told Berna?<br/>
<br/>
Let go.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
- Let go! It's all right.<br/>
- What's the problem?<br/>
<br/>
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on, Pena?<br/>
<br/>
Playing the f*cking American?<br/>
<br/>
Did you see what they did to his son?<br/>
<br/>
How many families has Pablo Escobar<br/>
destroyed, Pena? Do you know?<br/>
<br/>
You don't decide who lives and who dies.<br/>
<br/>
Don't be f*cking stupid.<br/>
This is how we do it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you're trying to prevent<br/>
Escobar`s family from entering Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Let's make something clear:<br/>
<br/>
If you've come to plead for them<br/>
as part of some deal, the only--<br/>
<br/>
No, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't come to plead for them.<br/>
I've come to plead for you.<br/>
<br/>
For me? How so?<br/>
<br/>
I know that you want Escobar d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
And while I don't agree with that,<br/>
I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
But this... this I can't understand.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't just wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It puts you, the president of Colombia,<br/>
in league with a death squad.<br/>
<br/>
Call the German chancellor.<br/>
Tell him to let the family in.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry to inform you that<br/>
your entry into Germany has been denied.<br/>
<br/>
I know my rights, sir.<br/>
But you don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
My children are in danger.<br/>
Send me any place other than Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him the children are under age.<br/>
We just want to live in peace...<br/>
<br/>
No. Tell him that's all we want to do.<br/>
<br/>
To live in peace.<br/>
<br/>
Get the children and your belongs.<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
They kick us out of the country and on top<br/>
of everything, they keep the money.<br/>
<br/>
I know. I'm going.<br/>
<br/>
What's this?<br/>
Why are we being treated this way?<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoyed Germany.<br/>
<br/>
- How much for this?<br/>
- Two thousand pesos.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies.<br/>
<br/>
Stop! National police!<br/>
<br/>
It's all right, ma'am, we're with<br/>
the national police. Come with us.<br/>
<br/>
The attorney general asked us to put you<br/>
under protective custody.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.<br/>
Come with us. You’ll be safe. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
- Come with us.<br/>
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
How can I help you, boss?<br/>
<br/>
I want this f*g of a president<br/>
to know what happens<br/>
<br/>
when you're on the side<br/>
of those bastards, Los Pepes.<br/>
<br/>
I want to see blood.<br/>
<br/>
I want the sky to burn with g*n.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to put the biggest b*mb<br/>
you can get your hands on<br/>
<br/>
as close as you can to<br/>
the Presidential Palace. Are we clean'?<br/>
<br/>
As you wish, boss.<br/>
<br/>
My love, let's go. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want one? Yes? How much?<br/>
<br/>
One hundred pesos.<br/>
<br/>
- Here.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Are we going that way?<br/>
- That way, darling.<br/>
<br/>
You better be a doctor when you grow up.<br/>
This is very expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Elena! Elena, let's go!<br/>
<br/>
Lift him up carefully!</div>]","Good morning.

Good morning, Mom.

- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting,

- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

-6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

I still have to buy the books, everything.

I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

And you still haven't lied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

And it goes in the hole.

That was a loud one.

LLUIS LODONO WHITE, SERVILE FRONT MAN AND
INITIATOR OF KIDNAPPINGS FOR PABLO ESCOBAR

Sit him there.

Over here.

Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

One... two... and three.

This family is the only thing
I care about.

- You're the one that--
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

- We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- All of this is your fault.

If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

I would never put this family in danger.

Tell her, Pablo.

Tell her ifs not my fault, Pablo.

- I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

Everything's all right, Mom.

It wasn't your fault.

Look at these smiling faces.

We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me'!

Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.

So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

That is my cocaine.

Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellin

until Pablo Escobar is d*ad.

That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

That's the Cali camel's strategy?

To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

We don't trust any drug tr*ffick.

Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

We all need friends.

Sir, would you like some?

Go!

Sir?

Are you all right?

Are you all right?

- We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

The k*ll of innocent civilians,
for starters.

Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

That's what priests are for, no?

The Castanos are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

But it's working.

Not if I stop providing you intel.

For what ifs worth, lam on your side.

I don't like what's happening.

Medellin is my home
and I love it very much.

As far as the methods
of the Castanos go...

well, those are the methods
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

Our guys fired a whole f*cking clip
at him, point blank.

Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

I need you to help me find him.

He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

What we want is to exterminate this rat.

That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Pena.

I've told you! You have to»

What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

Juliana... they're trying to k*ll me.
We have to get out of here.

I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

Can I see Simon, at least?

- Where-- Simon!
- Slop, Fernando!

Simon is at school.

Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please... leave.

- Oh, what's going on?
- How are you?

- Bye, Anda!
- Bye!

Where's Morn? Why do you have her can'?

Get in.

Come in.

Go on, son. Sit down.

So, you're being reassigned...

and you will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

You'll be all right there.

You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

Anything else?

Yes, sir, Colonel.

How are you, Papa?

And you?

- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

Do they have Disney World there?

I don't think so.

Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

You have every right to leave the country.

- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

Confess. Do you regret it?

Marrying me, or what?

Not for a second.

They may separate us...

but they'll never be able to destroy us.

Go.

The little bunny.

I'll take care of him, all right?

Give me a kiss.

Sergeant. Private Hugo Martinez Jr.
at your service, sir.

The colonel's son.

He said you have some
technical background.

I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

And I built a ham in my parents' house.

Great. What do you know about RDF?

The basic concept, sir.

The basic concept.

All right.

Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

And don't worry.

Unlike Carlos Castano,
this won't hit back.

What's going on?
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

That's Bogoté.
What do you expect?

Hey! What the f*ck is wrong with you?
Why are you networking?

Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

- Okay, okay.
- Pass me the phone, boy.

Make some f*cking b*mb.
You need an invitation to start working?

Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

And don't smoke near the g*n.

Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.

Thank the Virgin Mary.

That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

One more thing.

We hit those f*cking drugstores
pretty hard.

You tell us. Should we come home or--

No. Stay put. We're no': dune yet.

I may need you again.

Copy that, boss.

Thank you, Blackie.

Figure out... what time it is in Germany.

On it, boss.

Boss!

Boss!

Pena.

Any word on our friend?

Did you find him?

- Pena?
- Not yet.

What's up, Pena?

Are we getting a beer or what?

Another day, brother.

See you tomorrow.

No. What are you doing, Simon?

Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

What are we doing here?

I told you. We're going on a trip.

And what's happening? Where's my mom?

Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

You got yourself into trouble, didn't you?

Ifs because you work for Pablo Escobar.

That's why this is happening.

You're his lawyer.

What are we going to do now?

I have a plan. Calm down.

You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A f*cking thief.

Did you say ""son of a bitch""? ""Thief""?

I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

You want to call your mom?

Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

Are you going to be a p*ssy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

You didn't complain during the Christmases
or the birthdays

or when I bought you a motorcycle.

But now you're complaining. Very well!
Very well. It's over.

It's over! Now that they're
going to k*ll me, it's over.

I'm sorry... Simon.

I didn't mean to say that.

Forgive me.

Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

Was it a heart attack or what?

You fainted, Pablo.

How many of those are you taking?

I've had a terrible headache.

Those aren't any good, Pablo.

You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

Have you ever been to Disney World?

I haven't.

It's beautiful.

It's very organized. Very clean.

What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

Stress.

Stress is dangerous.

How's the weed working out?

I haven't been smoking a lot.

The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

He b*rned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

And that's what he did.

All right.

With you until death, Don Pablo.

Thank you.

I'd like to stay and stand guard.

All right. Thank you.

Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

There it is.

This is our stop.

- What's going on?
- What's happening?

- What's going on'?
- Can you give me back my passport?

That money is ours.

- Pablo, they're not letting us in.
- No, no! They can't do that.

That's what they're doing.

They can't--

Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

Don't worry, because--

Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

Don't touch me!
I'm asking you not to touch me.

Let go!

No!

Fernando Duque.

Javier Pena.

It took me one day to find you.

If you don't want them to k*ll you,
you need to start doing things better.

Please... get me out of here.

Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for'?

Well, our help isn't free.

We need full cooperation.

Dad!

Hey, Simon, it's all right.

Ifs all right. Go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

Ifs my son. He's... He's scared.

First, we'll get you to Holguin.
You’ll be safe--

No! No, we're staying here.

There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

I'll cooperate with you.
Anything you want.

I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

Is that a deal?

Do as I say.

Start by hiding your f*cking wife's car.

Hello, German embassy.

First of all, I'll k*ll every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

Then I will b*mb Frankfurt, Munich...

I'm going to shove b*mb up your asses,
you bastard f*ck.

n*zi, r*cist gonorrheas.
I'm going to k*ll all of you. You hear?

I'm going to k*ll all of you!

I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,

those t*rrorists who have attacked
my family and m*rder my associates.

Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

and yet you do nothing about it.

That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

There's a lot of interference.

Yes. Medellin has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

Not one?

Not one.

Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

Let's both start here: L9.329..329.

There it is.

I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

None other than that son of a bitch, Pena.
What do you think about that?

Who's your contact?

Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

And you know what
the worst part of this is?

We can no longer trust Pena.

Then we'll have to put a b*llet in him.

No.

We can't k*ll DEA agents.

Oh, no? Why not?

If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

Berna, look...

Schedule a meeting with Pena,
just as you have been.

We'll take care of the rest.

COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

Cordoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

Leonel Alvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along.

Did you follow me to the hotel?
You told Berna?

Let go.

Tell me, assh*le.

- Let go! It's all right.
- What's the problem?

I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

What's going on, Pena?

Playing the f*cking American?

Did you see what they did to his son?

How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Pena? Do you know?

You don't decide who lives and who dies.

Don't be f*cking stupid.
This is how we do it.

I understand that you're trying to prevent
Escobar`s family from entering Germany.

Let's make something clear:

If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only--

No, Mr. President.

I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

For me? How so?

I know that you want Escobar d*ad.

And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

But this... this I can't understand.

This isn't just wrong.

It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry to inform you that
your entry into Germany has been denied.

I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

Tell him the children are under age.
We just want to live in peace...

No. Tell him that's all we want to do.

To live in peace.

Get the children and your belongs.

Please.

They kick us out of the country and on top
of everything, they keep the money.

I know. I'm going.

What's this?
Why are we being treated this way?

Let's go.

Pardon me.

I hope you enjoyed Germany.

- How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

Thank you.

Ladies.

Stop! National police!

It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

The attorney general asked us to put you
under protective custody.

Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You’ll be safe. Let's go.

- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

How can I help you, boss?

I want this f*g of a president
to know what happens

when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los Pepes.

I want to see blood.

I want the sky to burn with g*n.

I want you to put the biggest b*mb
you can get your hands on

as close as you can to
the Presidential Palace. Are we clean'?

As you wish, boss.

My love, let's go. Let's go.

Do you want one? Yes? How much?

One hundred pesos.

- Here.
- Thank you.

- Are we going that way?
- That way, darling.

You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

Elena! Elena, let's go!

Lift him up carefully!"
02x06 - Los Pepes,"[<div class=""content"">Bastard.<br/>
<br/>
- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.<br/>
- I'm betting on the boss, too.<br/>
<br/>
This one is going to be easy.<br/>
They always let the boss win.<br/>
<br/>
That's true, but if someone’s going<br/>
to b*at him, it's this guy.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me something. Are you a p*ssy?<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on?<br/>
- You're a little slow, son.<br/>
<br/>
Careful, son, careful!<br/>
Keep looking forward, son!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, shit!<br/>
<br/>
All right, boys,<br/>
start getting that money out.<br/>
<br/>
Weighty. I'm missing 20.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it looks like you won some money, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we're enjoying ourselves, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Very good, son.<br/>
<br/>
- Very good.<br/>
- What? Did he get pissed?<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know why you won?<br/>
<br/>
That little trick. The same one, right?<br/>
<br/>
Don't be an idiot.<br/>
You know why you lost, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Because you're a very smart guy,<br/>
but you're too stubborn. You understand?<br/>
<br/>
What I understand is I don't like to lose.<br/>
Especially because of tricks.<br/>
<br/>
- Someone had to teach you how to lose.<br/>
- Yeah, why!<br/>
<br/>
- Very well, you son of a bitch.<br/>
- Boss?<br/>
<br/>
- A photo?<br/>
- Sure, but not with that pansy.<br/>
<br/>
No. You go over there.<br/>
Over there, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Cousin.<br/>
<br/>
It's because he doesn't know<br/>
how to lose, but that's fine.<br/>
<br/>
- Where are we headed, guys?<br/>
- To the whores!<br/>
<br/>
Look how they left this place.<br/>
<br/>
We found both the guards.<br/>
Stuffed into a trunk, b*rned alive.<br/>
<br/>
Did anybody see anything?<br/>
<br/>
We're sending spotters out, but...<br/>
they either come back with nothing or--<br/>
<br/>
- Or what?<br/>
- Or they don't come back.<br/>
<br/>
That bitch Judy Moncada did this.<br/>
<br/>
But she couldn't do this alone.<br/>
No f*cking way.<br/>
<br/>
The guys that came at me<br/>
had high-end w*apon.<br/>
<br/>
Big ones.<br/>
<br/>
Gringo shit.<br/>
<br/>
The Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
I f*cking know it.<br/>
<br/>
Those sons of bitches will regret it.<br/>
<br/>
I will personally burn that f*cking city<br/>
to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know that Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Until we know who did it, we can't attack<br/>
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Get whoever we can out on the street.<br/>
Give them cash.<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone needs more persuasion,<br/>
motivate them.<br/>
<br/>
Put the word out. We're going to k*ll<br/>
all the bastards who did this.<br/>
<br/>
I know I hit one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope he's still breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Because then...<br/>
<br/>
we can find out who that son of a bitch<br/>
is working for.<br/>
<br/>
PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS<br/>
LOS PEPES<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY HOLIDAYS<br/>
<br/>
Good day.<br/>
<br/>
In a letter sent to the media, a group<br/>
that identifies itself as ""Los Pepes,""<br/>
<br/>
an acronym for<br/>
""People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar.""<br/>
<br/>
...or ""People Persecuted<br/>
by Pablo Escobar, ""<br/>
<br/>
the vigilantes waging w*r on those<br/>
associated with the notorious drug lord.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President, the media is asking<br/>
for a comment on Los Pepes.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs only a matter of time<br/>
before it's made public.<br/>
<br/>
Acknowledgment isn't the same<br/>
as condemning.<br/>
<br/>
Sooner or later, you'll have to make<br/>
an official public statement.<br/>
<br/>
They're doing God's work<br/>
as far as I'm concerned.<br/>
<br/>
- That can't be our official position.<br/>
- It can be our official position...<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen!<br/>
<br/>
Los Pepes is a vigilante death squad.<br/>
<br/>
We'll take care of them<br/>
when the time comes.<br/>
<br/>
But for now, let's focus<br/>
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that's proven<br/>
a big enough job for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Our communications department has picked<br/>
up conversations in the Manrique district<br/>
<br/>
between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's<br/>
sicarios, and his mother, who is iii.<br/>
<br/>
We know Jairo is her only child<br/>
and likely to visit her.<br/>
<br/>
We'll continue to monitor the frequencies<br/>
for further information.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have to tell you that there's<br/>
another group now operating in Medellin,<br/>
<br/>
combating Escobar: Los Pepes.<br/>
<br/>
Let me be very clear.<br/>
<br/>
There must and will be a clear line<br/>
between them and us.<br/>
<br/>
Understood?<br/>
- Yes, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Dismissed, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
CNP's been busy with wiretaps.<br/>
<br/>
They picked up chatter<br/>
from Jairo`s mom here... and here.<br/>
<br/>
Search Bloc won't be able to move until<br/>
they get corroboration he's in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Which could take days.<br/>
<br/>
Even longer... for them to find the house.<br/>
<br/>
I think... Jairo is planning a homecoming.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe even today.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see what I can find out<br/>
on the streets.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello?<br/>
- Listen up, Carlos,<br/>
<br/>
I have information that Jairo<br/>
is going to his mother's.<br/>
<br/>
- National Police, can you open up?<br/>
- What do you need?<br/>
<br/>
Open up. Hurry'. Hurry.<br/>
<br/>
Don't make me k*ll you<br/>
in front of your mother.<br/>
<br/>
Don't touch her!<br/>
<br/>
Relax, mother, relax.<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am, if you don't cooperate,<br/>
we won't be able to find your son.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't know where he is.<br/>
I didn't notice anything.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have enemies here<br/>
in the neighborhood?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
It was my fault that he was here.<br/>
<br/>
He came to see his mother...<br/>
<br/>
IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
- What did you ask Santa for?<br/>
- A game.<br/>
<br/>
- Which one?<br/>
- The Joker game.<br/>
<br/>
You think he'll bring it to you?<br/>
<br/>
Dad?<br/>
<br/>
Santa is going to bring me<br/>
the Joker game, right?<br/>
<br/>
Dad?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, my love?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Santa will bring you<br/>
everything you want, like always.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas without Christ.<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on going to<br/>
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
What? No.<br/>
No one should leave this house.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure the kids would love<br/>
to see the lights.<br/>
<br/>
The children are staying here<br/>
and so are you.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the first time<br/>
you saw the fireworks?<br/>
<br/>
My love, can you tell your mother<br/>
she can't take the children to Medellin?<br/>
<br/>
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a month<br/>
since I've gone to church.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that God<br/>
can hear your prayers from here.<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, they k*ll three more of our men.<br/>
<br/>
They found Jairo d*ad next to the river.<br/>
<br/>
Look, ifs the Baccarat Crystal.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.<br/>
- Feel the weight. Look...<br/>
<br/>
You can feel it's Baccarat.<br/>
This is from the Lloredas, right'?<br/>
<br/>
How's it going, my love?<br/>
<br/>
My love, look at what<br/>
the Lloredas brought.<br/>
<br/>
Look, there's two.<br/>
<br/>
The Lloredas always treat us well...<br/>
<br/>
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN<br/>
""LOS PEPES""<br/>
<br/>
As gratifying as these displays may feel,<br/>
I'm not comfortable with these signs.<br/>
<br/>
They invite too much attention<br/>
and will lead to questions.<br/>
<br/>
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar<br/>
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Without a doubt.<br/>
<br/>
No more proclamations or manifestos<br/>
or letters to the media.<br/>
<br/>
What about Miami?<br/>
<br/>
We buy time.<br/>
<br/>
Let him think he still has control.<br/>
<br/>
Until the moment we take it from him.<br/>
<br/>
- New intel from the embassy.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you have for me, Pena?<br/>
- I got something new.<br/>
<br/>
- Blackie.<br/>
- I like the way this is going, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,<br/>
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.<br/>
<br/>
It'll take a while.<br/>
Blackie`s going to show.<br/>
<br/>
It's done.<br/>
<br/>
Almighty Holy Child of Atocha.<br/>
Carmelita, help me please.<br/>
<br/>
Don't fight with me anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to tell you two things:<br/>
First, relax.<br/>
<br/>
That's harmful for you and the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Second, for the love of God,<br/>
take the money.<br/>
<br/>
I'll find more later.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs not for you or me, it's for the baby,<br/>
please understand.<br/>
<br/>
Try to understand me.<br/>
I don't want your money.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to be with me<br/>
and the baby, that's it.<br/>
<br/>
Stop being stupid, girl.<br/>
We need that money.<br/>
<br/>
- Listen to your dad.<br/>
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.<br/>
<br/>
She's stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
Post three is in position.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to me. We're just getting here.<br/>
<br/>
Copy that, we're leaving now.<br/>
<br/>
It was Berna.<br/>
The streets are full of Search Bloc.<br/>
<br/>
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.<br/>
Let's get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on?<br/>
- Nothing, sir.<br/>
<br/>
We're conducting a police operation.<br/>
All good?<br/>
<br/>
Let him through.<br/>
<br/>
Keep calm, guys.<br/>
Hide your w*apon while we handle this.<br/>
<br/>
Let him through.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening, what can I do for you?<br/>
<br/>
Good afternoon, gentleman.<br/>
I need to see some form of ID, please.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, with pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
How's this for an ID?<br/>
<br/>
Get out of the car and put your hands<br/>
where I can see them.<br/>
<br/>
Quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, come over here.<br/>
<br/>
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.<br/>
- What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
- Armed men attempting to pass through.<br/>
- Checkpoint 20?<br/>
<br/>
That's correct, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- All units move to position 20.<br/>
- Understood.<br/>
<br/>
All units to position 20.<br/>
<br/>
My love, you have to take the money.<br/>
<br/>
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.<br/>
<br/>
Take care of the baby!<br/>
Take care, Carmelita!<br/>
<br/>
We're both on the same team here.<br/>
What's the problem?<br/>
<br/>
Stay where you are!<br/>
Hands where I can see them.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, relax.<br/>
<br/>
Want to see my ID?<br/>
<br/>
Take it out slowly.<br/>
<br/>
You point a g*n at me, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Move those cars because<br/>
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.<br/>
<br/>
Relax!<br/>
<br/>
Disarm!<br/>
<br/>
- No, you disarm.<br/>
- Sir.<br/>
<br/>
Lower your firearm.<br/>
<br/>
Easy!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, tough guys. Bravo!<br/>
<br/>
Bravo!<br/>
<br/>
Bravo, yes, we know it.<br/>
We all want Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
But let us do the f*cking job.<br/>
<br/>
What? You want to k*ll each other<br/>
at a checkpoint?<br/>
<br/>
Lower your w*apon. Lower it.<br/>
<br/>
Lower it.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. These dreamers<br/>
think they're helping.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Let's go home alive.<br/>
<br/>
""Okay?<br/>
""Okay:.<br/>
<br/>
- Let them pass.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Well then, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- What happened? Everything okay? Yes?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Miss, we need your cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us where Blackie is.<br/>
Where do we find him?<br/>
<br/>
I told you. I haven't seen him.<br/>
<br/>
Don't be afraid. We don't want you.<br/>
<br/>
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, I told you,<br/>
I don't know where he's at.<br/>
<br/>
That bastard has not come around<br/>
in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, let's go to the station.<br/>
But I told you, I don't know where he is.<br/>
<br/>
So please leave my house.<br/>
<br/>
They were eight, maybe ten.<br/>
<br/>
How did they take your firearm?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Next time, might as well<br/>
put the g*n to your own head.<br/>
<br/>
It's easier.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President, these men, the Castanos,<br/>
<br/>
I've seen their tactics firsthand<br/>
in the jungle against the FARO.<br/>
<br/>
Their method of w*r is m*rder.<br/>
I think this is only the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
And it win get even worse.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel, I understand your concern.<br/>
<br/>
It's strange. They usually operate<br/>
against the guerrillas<br/>
<br/>
but now they're operating<br/>
against the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating<br/>
the best course of action<br/>
<br/>
with regard to Los Pepes.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, I'd like your permission<br/>
to engage them.<br/>
<br/>
No. The greatest service we can do<br/>
for this nation is capture Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
R's our priority.<br/>
<br/>
I understand. Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take a look at this injury.<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to hurt.<br/>
Tell me who you work for.<br/>
<br/>
The Castanos.<br/>
<br/>
The Castanos.<br/>
<br/>
What could have brought them<br/>
out of the jungle?<br/>
<br/>
I say it was money.<br/>
<br/>
More money than Judy Moncada can find.<br/>
<br/>
Now is not the time<br/>
to take on more problems, brother.<br/>
<br/>
The Cali cartel thinks<br/>
they're immune to attack.<br/>
<br/>
This can't go unanswered.<br/>

<br/>
Go.<br/>
<br/>
Carlos, you scared me.<br/>
<br/>
Tata, you have to do it now.<br/>
Pablo's gone mad.<br/>
<br/>
With everything he's planning,<br/>
there will be consequences.<br/>
<br/>
You and the kids<br/>
need to separate from him.<br/>
<br/>
No, Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
Tata, my God, listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes<br/>
that I've never seen.<br/>
<br/>
The public declarations,<br/>
the open displays.<br/>
<br/>
They won't stop until he's d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
I know that, Carlos.<br/>
I've known for a long time now.<br/>
<br/>
You know what's the only thought<br/>
on my mind?<br/>
<br/>
That this is the last time...<br/>
<br/>
the last time<br/>
I'll look at my husband's face.<br/>
<br/>
The last time<br/>
I'll feel his arms around me.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I'll see him play<br/>
with our children.<br/>
<br/>
I automatically push that idea<br/>
out of my mind.<br/>
<br/>
And now?<br/>
<br/>
Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...<br/>
<br/>
I'll always be Pablo Escobar`s wife.<br/>
<br/>
My children will always<br/>
be Pablo Escobar's children.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we lived in exile with him.<br/>
<br/>
But without him?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
0kay'!-<br/>
<br/>
Let's do something.<br/>
<br/>
If we talk to him,<br/>
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.<br/>
<br/>
I've had a good life.<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?<br/>
<br/>
When my niece was growing up,<br/>
she didn't think this day would come.<br/>
<br/>
She was so skinny.<br/>
<br/>
- She wore glasses and had braces.<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 12,<br/>
she thought her life was over.<br/>
<br/>
I told her to wait and be patient.<br/>
<br/>
Someday her beauty on the outside<br/>
would match her beauty within.<br/>
<br/>
You have never looked more beautiful<br/>
than you do tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to the family.<br/>
<br/>
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
Wait!<br/>
<br/>
Wait!<br/>
<br/>
Ma! Papa! Papa!<br/>
<br/>
- I'm here, my love.<br/>
- Mom!<br/>
<br/>
That man...<br/>
<br/>
has no decency.<br/>
<br/>
To attack my family like this...<br/>
<br/>
my daughter...<br/>
<br/>
on the night of her wedding...<br/>
<br/>
Only a madman would do that.<br/>
<br/>
A crazed animal, dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
I want him d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Not next year. Right now.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll all of them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't just want you to k*ll his lawyers,<br/>
accountants and bankers...<br/>
<br/>
I want you to k*ll his secretaries...<br/>
<br/>
anyone who lifted a finger<br/>
to help that man.<br/>
<br/>
I want to see them d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp<br/>
and put it on an envelope in his name,<br/>
<br/>
I want to see them d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
And then I want you to find anyone who<br/>
ever shook his hand and k*ll them too!<br/>
<br/>
That son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
From this night, we'll show no mercy.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto?<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.<br/>
<br/>
That'll be all, Quica.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
I'm worried about Tata.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should let her travel.<br/>
She'll be safer.<br/>
<br/>
What you're doing will have consequences.<br/>
<br/>
That's why they're here. Right?<br/>
<br/>
That's why they're here with me,<br/>
to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
- Cali is going to want payback for--<br/>
- I know...<br/>
<br/>
who my enemies are, Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
And I can fight them all.<br/>
<br/>
I know that.<br/>
<br/>
But if Tata and the children<br/>
are out of the country,<br/>
<br/>
you'd be free to wage this w*r<br/>
with no holds barred.<br/>
<br/>
Let me ask you something.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
For Tata.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
To make her happier.<br/>
<br/>
To help her be more comfortable<br/>
with the life we're being forced to lead.<br/>
<br/>
Have you done that?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, my sister is terrified.<br/>
And you can't see that--<br/>
<br/>
Your sister is a lot tougher<br/>
than you think.<br/>
<br/>
My wife... and my children...<br/>
<br/>
stay with me.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Ma<br/>
'em?<br/>
<br/>
Take me to Mass.<br/>
<br/>
- But the boss said we couldn't.<br/>
- Pablo worries too much.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, you work for me.<br/>
<br/>
Our Father who art in heaven,<br/>
hallowed be thy name.<br/>
<br/>
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,<br/>
on earth, as it is in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Give us this day our daily bread<br/>
and forgive us our trespasses<br/>
<br/>
as we forgive those<br/>
who trespass against us.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs shameful for the country to stand by<br/>
while a group of mercenaries<br/>
<br/>
distributes its version<br/>
of perverse justice.<br/>
<br/>
It makes all of us look bad.<br/>
<br/>
- Including the president.<br/>
Especially the president.<br/>
<br/>
If he continues to allow Los Pepes<br/>
to do the dirty work,<br/>
<br/>
which is his responsibility...<br/>
<br/>
Colombia will never forgive him.<br/>
<br/>
MERRY CHRISTMAS<br/>
<br/>
Where were you?<br/>
<br/>
- I went to church.<br/>
- I told you it wasn't safe.<br/>
<br/>
And I told you that it would be fine.<br/>
And look, everything's fine.<br/>
<br/>
How could you put the children's lives<br/>
at risk?<br/>
<br/>
No one here is in danger.<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised at you, Pablo.<br/>
This one has always been nervous, but you?<br/>
<br/>
Don't talk that way to my husband.<br/>
<br/>
I can talk to him however I want.<br/>
I don't know why everyone is--<br/>
<br/>
Take Tata and the kids!<br/>
You, cover my mother!<br/>
<br/>
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!<br/>
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.<br/>
<br/>
Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
This way! Run!<br/>

Run quickly!<br/>

Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Get out!<br/>
<br/>
Carlos, let's go!<br/>
<br/>
Run, Limon, run!<br/>
<br/>
Let's go! Outside!<br/>
<br/>
- Come on, Tata, come on.<br/>
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!<br/>
<br/>

- Quickly!<br/>
<br/>
Give me the girl.<br/>
<br/>
Get in, Tata, get in.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!<br/>
<br/>
Move!<br/>
<br/>
They're in the house!<br/>
Let's go! Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
- Calm down.<br/>
- Don't let her move.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, boss! Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
- No!<br/>
- Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Come on!<br/>

- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.
- I'm betting on the boss, too.

This one is going to be easy.
They always let the boss win.

That's true, but if someone’s going
to b*at him, it's this guy.

Tell me something. Are you a p*ssy?

Son of a bitch.

- What's going on?
- You're a little slow, son.

Careful, son, careful!
Keep looking forward, son!

Oh, shit!

All right, boys,
start getting that money out.

Weighty. I'm missing 20.

Oh, it looks like you won some money, eh?

Of course, we're enjoying ourselves, boss.

Very good, son.

- Very good.
- What? Did he get pissed?

Hey.

Do you know why you won?

That little trick. The same one, right?

Don't be an idiot.
You know why you lost, Pablo?

Why?

Because you're a very smart guy,
but you're too stubborn. You understand?

What I understand is I don't like to lose.
Especially because of tricks.

- Someone had to teach you how to lose.
- Yeah, why!

- Very well, you son of a bitch.
- Boss?

- A photo?
- Sure, but not with that pansy.

No. You go over there.
Over there, f*ck.

Cousin.

It's because he doesn't know
how to lose, but that's fine.

- Where are we headed, guys?
- To the whores!

Look how they left this place.

We found both the guards.
Stuffed into a trunk, b*rned alive.

Did anybody see anything?

We're sending spotters out, but...
they either come back with nothing or--

- Or what?
- Or they don't come back.

That bitch Judy Moncada did this.

But she couldn't do this alone.
No f*cking way.

The guys that came at me
had high-end w*apon.

Big ones.

Gringo shit.

The Cali cartel.

I f*cking know it.

Those sons of bitches will regret it.

I will personally burn that f*cking city
to the ground.

We don't know that Pablo.

Until we know who did it, we can't attack
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

Get whoever we can out on the street.
Give them cash.

And if anyone needs more persuasion,
motivate them.

Put the word out. We're going to k*ll
all the bastards who did this.

I know I hit one of them.

Let's hope he's still breathing.

Because then...

we can find out who that son of a bitch
is working for.

PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

HAPPY HOLIDAYS

Good day.

In a letter sent to the media, a group
that identifies itself as ""Los Pepes,""

an acronym for
""People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar.""

...or ""People Persecuted
by Pablo Escobar, ""

the vigilantes waging w*r on those
associated with the notorious drug lord.

Mr. President, the media is asking
for a comment on Los Pepes.

Ifs only a matter of time
before it's made public.

Acknowledgment isn't the same
as condemning.

Sooner or later, you'll have to make
an official public statement.

They're doing God's work
as far as I'm concerned.

- That can't be our official position.
- It can be our official position...

Gentlemen!

Los Pepes is a vigilante death squad.

We'll take care of them
when the time comes.

But for now, let's focus
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.

I believe that's proven
a big enough job for all of us.

Our communications department has picked
up conversations in the Manrique district

between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's
sicarios, and his mother, who is iii.

We know Jairo is her only child
and likely to visit her.

We'll continue to monitor the frequencies
for further information.

One more thing.

I don't have to tell you that there's
another group now operating in Medellin,

combating Escobar: Los Pepes.

Let me be very clear.

There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

Understood?
- Yes, Colonel.

Dismissed, thank you.

CNP's been busy with wiretaps.

They picked up chatter
from Jairo`s mom here... and here.

Search Bloc won't be able to move until
they get corroboration he's in the area.

Which could take days.

Even longer... for them to find the house.

I think... Jairo is planning a homecoming.

Maybe even today.

I'll see what I can find out
on the streets.

- Hello?
- Listen up, Carlos,

I have information that Jairo
is going to his mother's.

- National Police, can you open up?
- What do you need?

Open up. Hurry'. Hurry.

Don't make me k*ll you
in front of your mother.

Don't touch her!

Relax, mother, relax.

Ma'am, if you don't cooperate,
we won't be able to find your son.

But I don't know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

Do you have enemies here
in the neighborhood?

I don't know.
It was my fault that he was here.

He came to see his mother...

IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

- What did you ask Santa for?
- A game.

- Which one?
- The Joker game.

You think he'll bring it to you?

Dad?

Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

Dad?

Pablo, my love?

Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

Christmas without Christ.

I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

What? No.
No one should leave this house.

I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights.

The children are staying here
and so are you.

Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellin?

Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

Don Pablo.

Boss, they k*ll three more of our men.

They found Jairo d*ad next to the river.

Look, ifs the Baccarat Crystal.

Thank you.

- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right'?

How's it going, my love?

My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

Look, there's two.

The Lloredas always treat us well...

NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN
""LOS PEPES""

As gratifying as these displays may feel,
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

Without a doubt.

No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

What about Miami?

We buy time.

Let him think he still has control.

Until the moment we take it from him.

- New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

- What do you have for me, Pena?
- I got something new.

- Blackie.
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

It'll take a while.
Blackie`s going to show.

It's done.

Almighty Holy Child of Atocha.
Carmelita, help me please.

Don't fight with me anymore.

I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

That's harmful for you and the baby.

Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

I'll find more later.

Ifs not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

She's stubborn.

Post three is in position.

Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.

Wait, Javier.

Talk to me. We're just getting here.

Copy that, we're leaving now.

It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

Let him through.

Keep calm, guys.
Hide your w*apon while we handle this.

Let him through.

Good evening, what can I do for you?

Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

Of course, with pleasure.

How's this for an ID?

Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

Quickly.

Boy, come over here.

- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

That's correct, sir.

- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

All units to position 20.

My love, you have to take the money.

Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

Relax, relax.

Want to see my ID?

Take it out slowly.

You point a g*n at me, f*ck?

Do me a favor.

Move those cars because
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.

Relax!

Disarm!

- No, you disarm.
- Sir.

Lower your firearm.

Easy!

Okay, tough guys. Bravo!

Bravo!

Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

But let us do the f*cking job.

What? You want to k*ll each other
at a checkpoint?

Lower your w*apon. Lower it.

Lower it.

Okay. These dreamers
think they're helping.

- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

Okay. Let's go home alive.

""Okay?
""Okay:.

- Let them pass.
- Okay.

Well then, thank you.

- What happened? Everything okay? Yes?
- Yes, sir.

Miss, we need your cooperation.

Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

I told you. I haven't seen him.

Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

So please leave my house.

They were eight, maybe ten.

How did they take your firearm?

I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.

Next time, might as well
put the g*n to your own head.

It's easier.

Mr. President, these men, the Castanos,

I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARO.

Their method of w*r is m*rder.
I think this is only the beginning.

And it win get even worse.

Colonel, I understand your concern.

It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

but now they're operating
against the narcos.

Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

with regard to Los Pepes.

Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

R's our priority.

I understand. Thank you, sir.

Let's take a look at this injury.

Very good.

This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

The Castanos.

The Castanos.

What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

I say it was money.

More money than Judy Moncada can find.

Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

This can't go unanswered.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Go.

Carlos, you scared me.

Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

You and the kids
need to separate from him.

No, Carlos.

Tata, my God, listen to me.

There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

The public declarations,
the open displays.

They won't stop until he's d*ad.

I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

That this is the last time...

the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

And now?

Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

I'll always be Pablo Escobar`s wife.

My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

Even if we lived in exile with him.

But without him?

No.

0kay'!-

Let's do something.

If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

I've had a good life.

Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?

When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

She was so skinny.

- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

I told her to wait and be patient.

Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

Cheers to the family.

To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

Wait!

Wait!

Ma! Papa! Papa!

- I'm here, my love.
- Mom!

That man...

has no decency.

To attack my family like this...

my daughter...

on the night of her wedding...

Only a madman would do that.

A crazed animal, dangerous.

I want him d*ad.

Not next year. Right now.

k*ll all of them.

I don't just want you to k*ll his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

I want you to k*ll his secretaries...

anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

I want to see them d*ad.

Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp
and put it on an envelope in his name,

I want to see them d*ad.

And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and k*ll them too!

That son of a bitch.

From this night, we'll show no mercy.

Gilberto?

Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.

That'll be all, Quica.

Thank you, boss.

Pablo?

I'm worried about Tata.

I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

What you're doing will have consequences.

That's why they're here. Right?

That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

- Cali is going to want payback for--
- I know...

who my enemies are, Carlos.

And I can fight them all.

I know that.

But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

you'd be free to wage this w*r
with no holds barred.

Let me ask you something.

Why are you here?

For Tata.

Right?

To make her happier.

To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

Have you done that?

Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that--

Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

My wife... and my children...

stay with me.

Hello.

Ma
'em?

Take me to Mass.

- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

Besides, you work for me.

Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

Ifs shameful for the country to stand by
while a group of mercenaries

distributes its version
of perverse justice.

It makes all of us look bad.

- Including the president.
Especially the president.

If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

which is his responsibility...

Colombia will never forgive him.

MERRY CHRISTMAS

Where were you?

- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

How could you put the children's lives
at risk?

No one here is in danger.

I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
This one has always been nervous, but you?

Don't talk that way to my husband.

I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is--

Take Tata and the kids!
You, cover my mother!

Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.

Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!

This way! Run!

Run quickly!

Pablo!

Get out!

Carlos, let's go!

Run, Limon, run!

Let's go! Outside!

- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

- quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

Give me the girl.

Get in, Tata, get in.

Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!

Move!

They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

Come on, boss! Let's go.

- No!
- Pablo!

Come on!

Boss, come on!

Let's go, boss!

Come on!

Let's go!

Los Pepes...

the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

the Castanos, the government, the gringos.

Let the bastards come.

We'll be ready for a w*r,
a f*cking bloodbath.

We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

Yes, boss.

Go for food and you go for firewood.

Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

I promise you.

Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us'?

Santa...

Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

Wherever you are in this world.

Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

Go to Envigado for food and wood.

- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

Got it.

This is all I could find, boss.

How do you open that shit?

I'll go look, boss.

This just came in.

Shit`s getting real, Pena.

Mommy, I'm cold.

She's freezing.

Put this on.

You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

It won't be long.

Soon we'll be together again.

Forever."
02x05 - The Enemies of My Enemy,"[<div class=""content"">I'm sure you recognize some of these<br/>
people, right? Agent Pena?<br/>
<br/>
It looks like you raided<br/>
the family album...<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Moncada.<br/>
<br/>
Please, call me Judy.<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you...<br/>
<br/>
before this son of a bitch<br/>
k*ll my husband and my brother,<br/>
<br/>
all these people were my friends.<br/>
What do you think of that?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it looks to me<br/>
like you made some new friends. No?<br/>
<br/>
We might say that we share a common goal.<br/>
<br/>
- The same as yours, Agent Pena.<br/>
- Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like you to listen<br/>
to what we have to say.<br/>
<br/>
You want to catch Escobar,<br/>
just like we do.<br/>
<br/>
But let's not lie to ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
You haven't been able to get close to him.<br/>
<br/>
The only play you had to get to him<br/>
was using Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
And we know how that ended, right?<br/>
<br/>
So, you're taking a break<br/>
from burning down villages?<br/>
<br/>
What we do is fill in<br/>
for an absent government.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to k*ll everyone<br/>
close to Escobar one by one.<br/>
<br/>
Until he's alone. With nothing.<br/>
<br/>
What we want, Mr. Pena,<br/>
<br/>
is to make Escobar understand<br/>
he is not untouchable.<br/>
<br/>
We want him to be afraid.<br/>
<br/>
There's just one small problem.<br/>
<br/>
Just one?<br/>
<br/>
To catch him, we need the satellite<br/>
technology and surveillance<br/>
<br/>
that your government has, Agent Pena.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm just going to...<br/>
hand that over to you?<br/>
<br/>
We have been partners for a while now,<br/>
Agent Pena.<br/>
<br/>
All the information that he gave to you,<br/>
I gave to him.<br/>
<br/>
We are simply making...<br/>
a small adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the drink.<br/>
<br/>
Too much stupidity for my liking.<br/>
<br/>
The Castanos can be useful.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking about you.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a narco.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe in honor and loyalty,<br/>
like you.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
Berna. Go get the car.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to give me a cigarette<br/>
or what?<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
we really want you to realize, Agent Pena,<br/>
<br/>
the potential of what we're offering you.<br/>
<br/>
Because, well...<br/>
with all the information in the world,<br/>
<br/>
you still have to be a policeman, right?<br/>
<br/>
I know what it feels like<br/>
when Pablo k*ll someone close to you.<br/>
<br/>
What's that?<br/>
<br/>
Information that would be<br/>
very valuable to you.<br/>
<br/>
That was very easy for us to find.<br/>
Take it.<br/>
<br/>
She's staying with a friend.<br/>
That little girl, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
The woman that betrayed you<br/>
and got Carrillo k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find her there.<br/>
<br/>
I told you we have an enemy in common.<br/>
<br/>
If you change your mind, give us a ring.<br/>
<br/>
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC k*ll<br/>
COLONEL HORACIO CARRILLO<br/>
<br/>
- Look, Dad.<br/>
- Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
- Nine point seven.<br/>
- Why?<br/>
<br/>
I would've given you a ten,<br/>
but here, next to me,<br/>
<br/>
is an Argentinian judge who's very picky.<br/>
<br/>
Very picky.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you jump in here with me?<br/>
<br/>
If I dive in there,<br/>
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.<br/>
<br/>
And you... And what are you doing,<br/>
my little love?<br/>
<br/>
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.<br/>
Like a little pair of scissors.<br/>
<br/>
That's right, like a little puppy.<br/>
<br/>
That's it, beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, ladies.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are in the pool.<br/>
Does someone know how to swim?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah, boss, they call me ""Flipper.""<br/>
- Flipper'?<br/>
<br/>
You talk so much shit, Blackie. You'd sink<br/>
like a rock tied to a heavier rock.<br/>
<br/>
Eat shit, Velasco.<br/>
<br/>
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Not in Flipper.<br/>
<br/>
Flipper.<br/>
<br/>
""They call me Flipper.""<br/>
<br/>
- What's the score?<br/>
- Two to zero.<br/>
<br/>
The National team is winning.<br/>
We're k*ll them!<br/>
<br/>
That's it!<br/>
<br/>
Careful with that little dance.<br/>
You're starting to put ideas in my head.<br/>
<br/>
Love, who is picking up Carlos?<br/>
<br/>
La Quica. He's on his way.<br/>
<br/>
That smells good.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, the kids love this place.<br/>
<br/>
- It's nice, isn't it?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
On your feet. Now!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.<br/>
Limon lied to me.<br/>
<br/>
No, please. When they find me,<br/>
they're going to k*ll me.<br/>
<br/>
- No!<br/>
- Stay still!<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I wanted this?<br/>
<br/>
They used me<br/>
and they're throwing my life away.<br/>
<br/>
You're all the same.<br/>
<br/>
You don't listen. Nobody listens!<br/>
<br/>
And all those people dying for no reason.<br/>
<br/>
What's up, Pena?<br/>
What should we do with her?<br/>
<br/>
Is that your father?<br/>
<br/>
Over there with the president?<br/>
<br/>
That's cool.<br/>
<br/>
To all those present,<br/>
it is my honor to present<br/>
<br/>
the President of the Republic...<br/>
<br/>
His Excellency,<br/>
Don César Gaviria Trujillo.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations, Class of 1992.<br/>
<br/>
Recent events...<br/>
<br/>
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice<br/>
your personal interests...<br/>
<br/>
and dedicate your lives<br/>
to the service of the nation.<br/>
<br/>
There is no higher honor...<br/>
<br/>
than to serve your homeland.<br/>
<br/>
- Colonel, how are you doing?<br/>
- Very well.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed your speech very much,<br/>
Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad. It was also for you.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,<br/>
I've been discussing with my advisors<br/>
<br/>
who should be at the head<br/>
of the Search Bloc.<br/>
<br/>
They mentioned many names.<br/>
<br/>
But I would like it to be you,<br/>
Colonel Martinez.<br/>
<br/>
That's an honor, Mr. President,<br/>
but at this point in my career,<br/>
<br/>
- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.<br/>
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
And I know you're the man to do it.<br/>
<br/>
The nation deserves someone<br/>
better than me.<br/>
<br/>
Your son was one of the best<br/>
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.<br/>
<br/>
He worked very hard.<br/>
I'm very proud of him.<br/>
<br/>
We asked the best in the class<br/>
to join the Search Bloc.<br/>
<br/>
And your son happily accepted.<br/>
<br/>
I ask that you at least<br/>
consider my request.<br/>
<br/>
For Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on. Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
- I can't believe it. Look at you.<br/>
- Slowly.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want any more visits<br/>
to the doctor.<br/>
<br/>
- Manuela, you're so beautiful. Look at me.<br/>
- Look how tan he is.<br/>
<br/>
- He looks like a movie star, right?<br/>
- Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
- He looks like Tom Cruise.<br/>
- Well...<br/>
<br/>
Look at her, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe you brought me all the way<br/>
from Miami to see my sister like this.<br/>
<br/>
No. I'm just so happy to see you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God. Carlos!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, sweetie.<br/>
I'm so happy to have you home.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, I am going to make<br/>
the best meal this family has ever had.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then...<br/>
ready to go for a little walk?<br/>
<br/>
It's incredible how much the children<br/>
have grown, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Manuelita is a princess. She is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
She's the one who controls everything<br/>
around here. I just pay the bills.<br/>
<br/>
I heard about Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
If that son of a bitch was still alive,<br/>
many more policemen would have died.<br/>
<br/>
I did the police a favor. Believe me.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the police agree with you?<br/>
<br/>
No one wants w*r, Carlos.<br/>
Especially when they know they would lose.<br/>
<br/>
But all that's in the past.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm ready to get back to business.<br/>
I'm all in.<br/>
<br/>
- Tell me about Miami.<br/>
- What can I tell you, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
The demand keeps increasing<br/>
and the merchandise keeps on coming.<br/>
<br/>
Business hasn't been affected<br/>
by what happened at La Catedral,<br/>
<br/>
nor by what you did.<br/>
<br/>
Well, business can always<br/>
get better, right?<br/>
<br/>
Let's bring the Lion over here.<br/>
<br/>
I want to speak to him face to face,<br/>
like the old days.<br/>
<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
- Make some new arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
Some better ones.<br/>
<br/>
Quica.<br/>
<br/>
Give Velasco a call.<br/>
Tell him to find the Lion.<br/>
<br/>
Carlos and I want to speak to him<br/>
about business.<br/>
<br/>
It's time to get back<br/>
to making money, brother.<br/>
<br/>
- Like the good old days, Pablo.<br/>
- Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
What's up, Maritza?<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
The police are looking for me.<br/>
They want to put a b*llet in my head.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought<br/>
something good would come from all this.<br/>
<br/>
Something good?<br/>
<br/>
Let me come work with you.<br/>
<br/>
No, Maritza, you're crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I have to get this.<br/>
<br/>
Give me one second.<br/>
<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
Where the f*ck are you, Limon? Think you<br/>
can make me wait around for you, bitch?<br/>
<br/>
I'm close by, man.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, there's a lot of g*dd*mn traffic,<br/>
but I'm on my way.<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a f*ck if thaws traffic.<br/>
I need you here new!<br/>
<br/>
You have to take this shit with you,<br/>
so get your ass over here. Right now.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know, I know.<br/>
Forgive me. I'm on my way.<br/>
<br/>
Maritza, I have to go.<br/>
I can't help you right now.<br/>
<br/>
We already gave you money.<br/>
I'll call you later.<br/>
<br/>
And we'll figure it out,<br/>
but I can't right now.<br/>
<br/>
- Search Bloc.<br/>
- It's Pena.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner<br/>
of 38th and 24th streets. We need back up.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, but there's no authorization<br/>
to dispatch patrols.<br/>
<br/>
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.<br/>
He just entered the building.<br/>
<br/>
Return to base with the location.<br/>
We can ask for authorization from Bogota'.<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
And you'll show up next Tuesday,<br/>
son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
What time were you supposed to be here,<br/>
assh*le?<br/>
<br/>
You knew you had to make the delivery<br/>
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
No, brother, don't get mad.<br/>
It's just that--<br/>
<br/>
Limon!<br/>
<br/>
You're going to take this g*dd*mn bag<br/>
and get out of here now! I'm watching you.<br/>
<br/>
- Calm down.<br/>
- Calm down?!<br/>
<br/>
This is the last time you pull shit<br/>
like this, Limon. The last time!<br/>
<br/>
- This is the last time you make me wait.<br/>
- Come on, man--<br/>
<br/>
I told you. Get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
Shit. What do we do?<br/>
<br/>
We stick with Velasco.<br/>
The other one doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
How many guys do you think are inside,<br/>
Pena?<br/>
<br/>
Too many for just us two, no?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. We'd be screwed.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch.<br/>
We should call for backup, right'?<br/>
<br/>
Who are you calling?<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on, Pena?<br/>
- I'll handle this.<br/>
<br/>
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.<br/>
<br/>
You are finally seeing the light, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
Let's just see if this works.<br/>
<br/>
You two coming?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.<br/>
<br/>
Berna, with his men, around back.<br/>
Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Just stay clear of the windows.<br/>
<br/>
- Let's go, then.<br/>
- Let's move.<br/>
<br/>
- They're everywhere.<br/>
- Let's go down.<br/>
<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
Where were you going,<br/>
you filthy son of a bitch?<br/>
<br/>
Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
- What's that?<br/>
- It's a delivery.<br/>
<br/>
- But who told you to buy this?<br/>
- It was me.<br/>
<br/>
It's some clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Hermilda, for God's sake...<br/>
you can't send him outwith so much money.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, Tata!<br/>
- They are going to know where we are.<br/>
<br/>
You worry too much.<br/>
<br/>
It's going to affect the children. Do you<br/>
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?<br/>
<br/>
You're right.<br/>
<br/>
When Pablo was a little boy...<br/>
<br/>
he came home from school one day,<br/>
very angry.<br/>
<br/>
A little girl made fun of his shoes.<br/>
<br/>
They were ragged.<br/>
<br/>
And we didn't have any money<br/>
to buy him new ones.<br/>
<br/>
But that night, I went into town<br/>
and I stole a pair from a store.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, Pablo went back to school.<br/>
<br/>
Being poor is not an excuse<br/>
to look like you are.<br/>
<br/>
You've always just taken<br/>
what you wanted, right?<br/>
<br/>
And Pablo as well.<br/>
<br/>
It worked.<br/>
<br/>
We're even.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to help me get a visa<br/>
and get my family out of Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't work like that.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
So, then...?<br/>
<br/>
How am I supposed to be okay?<br/>
<br/>
Is this how things are going to work<br/>
from now on, Pena?<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about it, okay?<br/>
It won't happen again.<br/>
<br/>
No. I'm not worried.<br/>
<br/>
Leave us.<br/>
<br/>
Life's funny, Velasco.<br/>
<br/>
This could easily<br/>
have ended up in reverse.<br/>
<br/>
Me lying there,<br/>
you and your men ready to t*rture me.<br/>
<br/>
Look how everything's changed.<br/>
<br/>
We are both loyal soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Sewing our generals.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what?<br/>
<br/>
When it's time to give up your boss...<br/>
<br/>
we give up our boss.<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...<br/>
he gave up this.<br/>
<br/>
- Three of his accountants.<br/>
- And their addresses.<br/>
<br/>
He also told me Pablo<br/>
still has a large army and a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,<br/>
no? To scare us off.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could be true. To scare us off.<br/>

There lies the key.<br/>

Something else.<br/>
<br/>
Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
because the Lion will be arriving<br/>
in the afternoon from Miami.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Moncada.<br/>
<br/>
How can I help you?<br/>
<br/>
How was your trip? You must be b*at.<br/>
<br/>
Where's Velasco?<br/>
<br/>
There he is.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
- Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.<br/>
- Lion.<br/>
<br/>
This is my brother, Miguel.<br/>
<br/>
And this gentleman is our associate,<br/>
Pacho Herrera.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.<br/>
It's a pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Lion... May I call you that?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
- Have a drink. Relax.<br/>
<br/>
They say, over there,<br/>
that you like whiskey.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, gentlemen,<br/>
if I did something to offend you, or--<br/>
<br/>
What? Would we offer you a drink<br/>
if we were offended'?<br/>
<br/>
Have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me something, Lion.<br/>
<br/>
Do you like working for a thug?<br/>
<br/>
One...<br/>
<br/>
two, three!<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Good job.<br/>
<br/>
Look after your sister.<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, boss...<br/>
<br/>
Lion just called, sir.<br/>
<br/>
He said Velasco never showed up<br/>
at the airport, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Lion got scared shitless and left.<br/>
He took a plane back to Miami.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking Lion.<br/>
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?<br/>
<br/>
- And where is Velasco'?<br/>
- Boss, I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Find him for me.<br/>
<br/>
Right away, boss.<br/>
<br/>
- I can't believe you're cooking, Tata.<br/>
- But you know I always helped my mother.<br/>
<br/>
I helped while you ate.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I'm very happy<br/>
that Pablo brought me here.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm worried about you.<br/>
<br/>
No. There's no reason to worry.<br/>
<br/>
For God's sake, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
Every cop in the country<br/>
is looking for Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Every drug tr*ffick<br/>
who's not from Medellin wants him d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
And you're telling me there's no reason<br/>
to worry? Don't kid yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Today is a good day, Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
My family is all together. You're here.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo is a strong man.<br/>
He's always had to be.<br/>
<br/>
There's no reason to change anything now.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Come inside, I'm packing.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to let me go to Medellin<br/>
or what?<br/>
<br/>
Is that why you accepted the job?<br/>
<br/>
You never should have volunteered.<br/>
<br/>
But you can't be reassigned now,<br/>
because it would end your career, right?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, only now I'm gonna be<br/>
""the boss's son.""<br/>
<br/>
It appears to me you don't understand<br/>
what's happening.<br/>
<br/>
I accepted because I wanted<br/>
to help my country.<br/>
<br/>
Come here. I want to show you something.<br/>
<br/>
I received this urn with my name.<br/>
<br/>
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
It's an obituary.<br/>
<br/>
Look, son, you're going to do<br/>
exactly as I tell you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to make sure you survive this.<br/>

Since we unfortunately cannot rely on<br/>

<br/>
we are going to implement<br/>

We will position ourselves<br/>

<br/>

and his allies might be,<br/>
<br/>
proceed to search them...<br/>
<br/>
and if we don't find<br/>
what we're looking for,<br/>
<br/>
we'll process anything of value<br/>
and continue on to the next one.<br/>
<br/>
Understood?<br/>
- Yes, Colonel!<br/>
<br/>
What did you find out from Velasco?<br/>
<br/>
Not a f*cking thing.<br/>
<br/>
That son of a bitch turned out to be<br/>
a lot tougher than I thought.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what I think it is?<br/>
<br/>
Rules of the game:<br/>
<br/>
We only go after armed people. Sicarios.<br/>
<br/>
There won't be any information<br/>
about businesses or labs or shipments.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't about helping Judy.<br/>
This is about k*ll Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then...<br/>
<br/>
here's to k*ll Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
For Colombia!<br/>
<br/>
Follow me. Follow me and cover me!<br/>
<br/>
Boss?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to bother you, but something bad<br/>
is happening in the city, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Five of our men, d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Who was it?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, boss. If I knew,<br/>
I'd k*ll the son of a bitch that did it.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, I'm so sorry,<br/>
but La Quica's on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
- And Velasco?<br/>
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.<br/>
<br/>
No one's seen Velasco<br/>
and no one knows where he is. Boss...<br/>
<br/>
you know that if someone<br/>
grabbed Velasco...<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Stan packing.<br/>
<br/>
Your turn, let's do it again.<br/>
<br/>
My little rock made of paper...<br/>
<br/>
how much do you want to eat?<br/>
<br/>
Show your grandmother<br/>
how you washed your hands.<br/>
<br/>
Looks good.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me.<br/>
<br/>
Should we start?<br/>
<br/>
Dig in, dig in.<br/>
<br/>
- A little meat.<br/>
- So good.<br/>
<br/>
A Spoon?<br/>
<br/>
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?<br/>
<br/>
The Castanos are very efficient.<br/>
<br/>
But not very discreet.<br/>
<br/>
No one can know<br/>
we had anything to do with this.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.</div>]","I'm sure you recognize some of these
people, right? Agent Pena?

It looks like you raided
the family album...

Mrs. Moncada.

Please, call me Judy.

Let me tell you...

before this son of a bitch
k*ll my husband and my brother,

all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

We might say that we share a common goal.

- The same as yours, Agent Pena.
- Is that right?

Yes.

Wait, Javier.

I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

But let's not lie to ourselves.

You haven't been able to get close to him.

The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

And we know how that ended, right?

So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

We're going to k*ll everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

Until he's alone. With nothing.

What we want, Mr. Pena,

is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

We want him to be afraid.

There's just one small problem.

Just one?

To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

that your government has, Agent Pena.

And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Pena.

All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

Thanks for the drink.

Too much stupidity for my liking.

The Castanos can be useful.

I was talking about you.

Yes, Javier.

I'm a narco.

And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

Pablo doesn't.

Berna. Go get the car.

Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

Well...

we really want you to realize, Agent Pena,

the potential of what we're offering you.

Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

you still have to be a policeman, right?

I know what it feels like
when Pablo k*ll someone close to you.

What's that?

Information that would be
very valuable to you.

That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo k*ll.

You'll find her there.

I told you we have an enemy in common.

If you change your mind, give us a ring.

LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC k*ll
COLONEL HORACIO CARRILLO

- Look, Dad.
- Let's see.

- Nine point seven.
- Why?

I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

is an Argentinian judge who's very picky.

Very picky.

Why don't you jump in here with me?

If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

And you... And what are you doing,
my little love?

That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

That's right, like a little puppy.

That's it, beautiful.

Hey, ladies.

My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

- Yeah, boss, they call me ""Flipper.""
- Flipper'?

You talk so much shit, Blackie. You'd sink
like a rock tied to a heavier rock.

Eat shit, Velasco.

- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

Not in Flipper.

Flipper.

""They call me Flipper.""

- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

The National team is winning.
We're k*ll them!

That's it!

Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

Love, who is picking up Carlos?

La Quica. He's on his way.

That smells good.

Pablo, the kids love this place.

- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

On your feet. Now!

I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limon lied to me.

No, please. When they find me,
they're going to k*ll me.

- No!
- Stay still!

Please.

Do you think I wanted this?

They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

You're all the same.

You don't listen. Nobody listens!

And all those people dying for no reason.

What's up, Pena?
What should we do with her?

Is that your father?

Over there with the president?

That's cool.

To all those present,
it is my honor to present

the President of the Republic...

His Excellency,
Don César Gaviria Trujillo.

Congratulations, Class of 1992.

Recent events...

contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

There is no higher honor...

than to serve your homeland.

- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

I'm glad. It was also for you.

Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

They mentioned many names.

But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

That's an honor, Mr. President,
but at this point in my career,

- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

And I know you're the man to do it.

The nation deserves someone
better than me.

Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

And your son happily accepted.

I ask that you at least
consider my request.

For Colombia.

Come on, come on. Let's see.

Go ahead.

- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly.

I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

- Manuela, you're so beautiful. Look at me.
- Look how tan he is.

- He looks like a movie star, right?
- Yes, boss.

- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

Look at her, Pablo.

I can't believe you brought me all the way
from Miami to see my sister like this.

No. I'm just so happy to see you.

Oh, my God. Carlos!

Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

It's incredible how much the children
have grown, Pablo.

Manuelita is a princess. She is beautiful.

She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

I heard about Carrillo.

If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

I did the police a favor. Believe me.

Do you think the police agree with you?

No one wants w*r, Carlos.
Especially when they know they would lose.

But all that's in the past.

And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

nor by what you did.

Well, business can always
get better, right?

Let's bring the Lion over here.

I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

- Okay.
- Make some new arrangements.

Some better ones.

Quica.

Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

What's up, Maritza?

What happened?

The police are looking for me.
They want to put a b*llet in my head.

I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought
something good would come from all this.

Something good?

Let me come work with you.

No, Maritza, you're crazy.

I have to get this.

Give me one second.

What's up?

Where the f*ck are you, Limon? Think you
can make me wait around for you, bitch?

I'm close by, man.

I mean, there's a lot of g*dd*mn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

I don't give a f*ck if thaws traffic.
I need you here new!

You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

- Search Bloc.
- It's Pena.

I'm here with Trujillo at the corner
of 38th and 24th streets. We need back up.

I'm sorry, but there's no authorization
to dispatch patrols.

We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

Return to base with the location.
We can ask for authorization from Bogota'.

Sure.

And you'll show up next Tuesday,
son of a bitch.

What time were you supposed to be here,
assh*le?

You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that--

Limon!

You're going to take this g*dd*mn bag
and get out of here now! I'm watching you.

- Calm down.
- Calm down?!

This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limon. The last time!

- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man--

I told you. Get out of here.

Shit. What do we do?

We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

How many guys do you think are inside,
Pena?

Too many for just us two, no?

Yeah. We'd be screwed.

Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right'?

Who are you calling?

- What's going on, Pena?
- I'll handle this.

This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

You are finally seeing the light, Javier.

Let's just see if this works.

You two coming?

Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.

Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

Just stay clear of the windows.

- Let's go, then.
- Let's move.

- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

Hey!

Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch?

Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.

- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

It's some clothes.

Hermilda, for God's sake...
you can't send him outwith so much money.

- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

You worry too much.

It's going to affect the children. Do you
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

You're right.

When Pablo was a little boy...

he came home from school one day,
very angry.

A little girl made fun of his shoes.

They were ragged.

And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

The next day, Pablo went back to school.

Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

And Pablo as well.

It worked.

We're even.

I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellin.

Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

It doesn't work like that.

I'm sorry.

So, then...?

How am I supposed to be okay?

Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Pena?

Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

No. I'm not worried.

Leave us.

Life's funny, Velasco.

This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

Me lying there,
you and your men ready to t*rture me.

Look how everything's changed.

We are both loyal soldiers.

Sewing our generals.

But you know what?

When it's time to give up your boss...

we give up our boss.

Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

Or it could be true. To scare us off.

There lies the key.

If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

Something else.

Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow

because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

Mrs. Moncada.

How can I help you?

How was your trip? You must be b*at.

Where's Velasco?

There he is.

Welcome.

- Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

This is my brother, Miguel.

And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

Lion... May I call you that?

- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or--

What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended'?

Have a seat.

Tell me something, Lion.

Do you like working for a thug?

One...

two, three!

Very good.

Good job.

Look after your sister.

What happened?

Hey, boss...

Lion just called, sir.

He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

f*cking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

- And where is Velasco'?
- Boss, I have no idea.

Find him for me.

Right away, boss.

- I can't believe you're cooking, Tata.
- But you know I always helped my mother.

I helped while you ate.

You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

No. There's no reason to worry.

For God's sake, Tata.

Every drug tr*ffick
who's not from Medellin wants him d*ad.

And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

Today is a good day, Carlos.

My family is all together. You're here.

Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

There's no reason to change anything now.

I hope you're hungry.

Come inside, I'm packing.

Are you going to let me go to Medellin

the men of always aren't interested<br/>
in the children of never.<br/>
<br/>
- Of course.<br/>
- Right?<br/>
<br/>
I'm writing a letter to the editors<br/>
of the most important newspapers<br/>
<br/>
to tell them how that boy came to me,<br/>
scared for his life.<br/>
<br/>
The world has to know what sort of monster<br/>
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo, that's excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Give me that pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Burn everything.<br/>
<br/>
Don't move! Felix, take this one.<br/>
<br/>
Don't even think about it.<br/>
Up against the wall.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know yet. We're working on it.<br/>
<br/>
Are we having a good time?<br/>
<br/>
That's a very pretty girl.<br/>
<br/>
But you're paying for those lines,<br/>
assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
Clean this shit up!<br/>
<br/>
Who taught you to live like this?<br/>
Not from our mother!<br/>
<br/>
And wake up, assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
And you, Edgar!<br/>
<br/>
Call Pablo and ask him<br/>
where he wants us to take his half.<br/>
<br/>
All right. All right.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing calling<br/>
from that phone? Use the pay phone!<br/>
<br/>
- Relax, brother.<br/>
- Edgar...<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
- Have you been calling from this phone?<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a--<br/>
<br/>
Move it, f*g!<br/>
<br/>
Hey there.<br/>
<br/>
Dad?<br/>
<br/>
Quickly, inside!<br/>
- Friend.<br/>
<br/>
Calm down, friend.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is all right.<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
It's carbon rock.<br/>
<br/>
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.<br/>
<br/>
Did you think I bought chemistry labs<br/>
because I enjoyed the class in school?<br/>
<br/>
You're going to put chemists<br/>
out of business.<br/>
<br/>
I'm more interested<br/>
in putting Pablo out of business.<br/>
<br/>
Now's the time to move in on Miami.<br/>
<br/>
It won't be hard for us<br/>
to take that business.<br/>
<br/>
- But don't you think it's too early?<br/>
- Pablo's in hiding.<br/>
<br/>
The Search Bloc is k*ll his men.<br/>
Soon they'll catch him,<br/>
<br/>
and I want us to be in an advantageous<br/>
position when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Could you take care of that?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
But don't make it too obvious.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want Judy Moncada asking f*cking<br/>
questions and negotiating for a piece.<br/>
<br/>
Then you should call Pablo<br/>
<br/>
and tell him we'd be happy<br/>
to turn Judy over to him.<br/>
<br/>
We'll dump her in the same ditch<br/>
we'll be dumping him in.<br/>
<br/>
Guys.<br/>
<br/>
The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.<br/>
<br/>
The sons of bitches k*ll<br/>
three of the Prisco brothers.<br/>
<br/>
Ricardo got away.<br/>
<br/>
- When was this?<br/>
- Last night,<br/>
<br/>
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.<br/>
He's telling the cops everything.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hide out on the coast.<br/>
I'll convince Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Since when do we hide, brother?<br/>
<br/>
Let's trust the boss.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello?<br/>
- Get me Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Who is this?<br/>
- Fernando Duque.<br/>
<br/>
- Fernando.<br/>
- Get him now.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir, right away. Limon, please.<br/>
<br/>
Boss?<br/>
<br/>
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.<br/>
<br/>
- How many were published?<br/>
- Don Pablo,<br/>
<br/>
we sent all of them to the newspapers.<br/>
<br/>
How many of my letters were published,<br/>
Fernando'?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. None.<br/>
<br/>
They're very well written.<br/>
<br/>
It's not about how well written they were,<br/>
Fernando. It was the f*cking truth!<br/>
<br/>
This is why we saw ourselves forced<br/>
<br/>
to take up arms and defend ourselves...<br/>
<br/>
Move it, you sons of bitches!<br/>
<br/>
All right. Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Guys.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Judy.<br/>
<br/>
All right, now... I would like<br/>
to know the reason for this meeting.<br/>
<br/>
- You don't see this every day.<br/>
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.<br/>
<br/>
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
We know you all joined forces against him.<br/>
<br/>
And we want to know if it's possible<br/>
for my brother and Ito join the cause.<br/>
<br/>
Why? What do you want out of this?<br/>
<br/>
- We want what's best for Colombia.<br/>
- That's it?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar,<br/>
aside from being a t*rror1st,<br/>
<br/>
is also allied with the guerrillas,<br/>
who he has helped on many occasions.<br/>
<br/>
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar<br/>
is a patriotic act.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources<br/>
<br/>
combined with all of the information<br/>
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation<br/>
<br/>
-with our military experience--<br/>
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.<br/>
<br/>
No, Mrs. Moncada. No.<br/>
A death squad? No. An army.<br/>
<br/>
And when this army gets to Medellin,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar's death<br/>
won't be a matter of months.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be a matter of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say, Pacho?<br/>
<br/>
Can we count on the support<br/>
of you and your partners?<br/>
<br/>
All of this sounds interesting.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect, gentlemen,<br/>
<br/>
our organization already<br/>
has a strategy in place, and it's working.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.<br/>
<br/>
Because, to this day,<br/>
Pablo Escobar is still alive.<br/>
<br/>
- That's right.<br/>
- At this rate, not for long.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'll share this conversation<br/>
with our partners.<br/>
<br/>
But I think that, for now,<br/>
our answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.<br/>
- How did you find me?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.<br/>
<br/>
- And La Quica?<br/>
- He's not here.<br/>
<br/>
He's back there, looking for you.<br/>
<br/>
If he finds out that I'm here, he's going<br/>
to want to k*ll me too. Let's talk. Relax.<br/>
<br/>
Because of you,<br/>
I'll never be able to go back to Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
- Maritza!<br/>
Because of you,<br/>
<br/>
-my daughter and I have to live in hiding.<br/>
- Relax!<br/>
<br/>
I really am sorry,<br/>
and I'm here because I want to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Like you helped the girls<br/>
you used to drive around in your taxi?<br/>
<br/>
- I had nothing to do with that.<br/>
- And why would I believe you?<br/>
<br/>
Because you know me,<br/>
and I wouldn't do something like that.<br/>
<br/>
You k*ll me, Jhon.<br/>
<br/>
You k*ll me by putting me<br/>
in your f*cking taxi.<br/>
<br/>
You knew how badly I needed that money<br/>
and you took advantage of that.<br/>
<br/>
I really am sorry, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me. I think I have an idea<br/>
to get us both out of this.<br/>
<br/>
What is it?<br/>
<br/>
We'll give them what they want.<br/>
We'll give them Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
- What the f*ck are you saying?<br/>
- Believe me, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the one who drives Escobar.<br/>
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.<br/>
<br/>
- You can call the police.<br/>
- Maritza, what's going on here?<br/>
<br/>
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.<br/>
<br/>
Dona Liliana.<br/>
<br/>
- I don't trust the police.<br/>
- Listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
This is your chance<br/>
to get a visa from the Americans,<br/>
<br/>
so you can leave with your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
And you? What do you get out of this?<br/>
<br/>
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.<br/>
They're k*ll all of his men.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get out.<br/>
We both need to get out, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
All right. My turn.<br/>
<br/>
You both look beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
All right, my love, go to your room<br/>
so I can talk with your dad, all right?<br/>
<br/>
- Why didn't you tell me?<br/>
- What?<br/>
<br/>
Velasco told me.<br/>
<br/>
There are 20 men out there, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
How do you hold it?<br/>
<br/>
What? Are you sure you want to laugh<br/>
at your wife while she's holding a g*n?<br/>
<br/>
It's not a joke, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Those 20 men out there<br/>
don't care what happens to us.<br/>
<br/>
When the time comes,<br/>
it will just be you and me.<br/>
<br/>
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
But I think you need<br/>
more practice with that.<br/>
<br/>
- Javi, it's Gabriela.<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
<br/>
- It's been a while and I want to see you.<br/>
- Now?<br/>
<br/>
I can't right now. I'm working.<br/>
<br/>
Don't be like that.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Give me...<br/>
20 minutes, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
- I've got half an hour.<br/>
- Wait.<br/>
<br/>
- Javi...<br/>
- Come here. What's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
She's a friend of a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Maritza, meet Javier.<br/>
<br/>
And...<br/>
<br/>
why are you introducing me<br/>
to a friend of a friend?<br/>
<br/>
She's in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Just hear her out.<br/>
<br/>
Goddammit, Gabby.<br/>
You could have told me over the phone, no?<br/>
<br/>
- I knew you wouldn't come.<br/>
- Well, I'm leaving.<br/>
<br/>
- Bye!<br/>
- No. Wait. It's important.<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
Hear her out.<br/>
<br/>
What's your name? Maritza?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of trouble are you in?<br/>
<br/>
Who are you in trouble with?<br/>
<br/>
- La Quica.<br/>
- La Quica. You know La Quica?<br/>
<br/>
- He wants to k*ll me.<br/>
- Well...<br/>
<br/>
La Quica wants to k*ll a lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
Why does he want to k*ll you?<br/>
<br/>
Because I can tell you<br/>
where Pablo Escobar is.<br/>
<br/>
And how are you going to do that?<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly when and where<br/>
he'll be tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
If this is true, Colonel, she can tell us<br/>
when Limon and Escobar go somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Can you explain this?<br/>
<br/>
A subpoena.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to answer the questions<br/>
I have regarding La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
You mean your witch hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar<br/>
get out of that prison<br/>
<br/>
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?<br/>
<br/>
How many times do I have to tell you<br/>
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?<br/>
<br/>
He must have paid someone off.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that's<br/>
almost certainly the case.<br/>
<br/>
This is about transparency, truth, law.<br/>
<br/>
And I sense from your reluctance to speak<br/>
<br/>
that the truth will not be kind to you<br/>
or our esteemed president.<br/>
<br/>
Look, sir, what happened that night<br/>
was complicated and, yes,<br/>
<br/>
I must confess that we lost control<br/>
of the situation, we made mistakes,<br/>
<br/>
but we're talking about a national crisis.<br/>
<br/>
So what? Does that mean<br/>
that we should just trust you'?<br/>
<br/>
Look, sir... I ask you to please trust me.<br/>
<br/>
All you're doing by making<br/>
this investigation public<br/>
<br/>
is destroying the life of a very good<br/>
human being. Our president.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Maritza. It's me.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Pena.<br/>
<br/>
Pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
In one hour, I will take Pablo<br/>
to his accountant.<br/>
<br/>
He lives in the south. I need you to give<br/>
the Americans the address. Understand?<br/>
<br/>
Are we really going to turn in<br/>
Pablo Escobar'?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Maritza.<br/>
We're going to do this together.<br/>
<br/>
But I need you to trust me.<br/>
<br/>
Give me the address.<br/>
<br/>
Write it down.<br/>
<br/>
9th street with 98-3. Got it?<br/>
<br/>
Got it.<br/>
<br/>
...my love. Do it again.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, boss.<br/>
You'll be late to your appointment.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Limon. A kiss.<br/>
<br/>
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.<br/>
One, two, and...<br/>
<br/>
Everything all right, boss?<br/>
<br/>
9th Street. 98-3.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Got it.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
Now turn off the satellite phones.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be out in 20 minutes.<br/>
So be on alert.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Attention! We're headed out!<br/>
<br/>
We're on San Juan.<br/>
<br/>
Everything's calm.<br/>
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Blondie.<br/>
<br/>
It's burning!<br/>
<br/>
Reverse!<br/>
<br/>
It's an ambush!<br/>
<br/>
Sabada!<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo, respond!<br/>
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
Look at me.<br/>
<br/>
Look at me.<br/>
<br/>
You asked a child to give me this.<br/>
<br/>
You can have it back.<br/>
<br/>
And this... is for my cousin, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Coward.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.<br/>
<br/>
They're saying that Pablo himself<br/>
k*ll Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
Next, he'll come after the two of you.<br/>
<br/>
Or me, or you, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
No, we've got to come up<br/>
with another plan.<br/>
<br/>
Another approach.<br/>
Another way to achieve our goals.<br/>
<br/>
Pacho, we need to call the Castanos.<br/>
<br/>
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...<br/>
and they're already asking for my head.<br/>
<br/>
They want a scapegoat.<br/>
<br/>
And we have to give them one.<br/>
<br/>
That's why we're going to say that you<br/>
were poorly advised by your vice minister.<br/>
<br/>
- We can find another way.<br/>
- Let me finish.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to say that I acted alone<br/>
and without authorization<br/>
<br/>
when I entered La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
And that it was I who insisted<br/>
that Carrillo return.<br/>
<br/>
I don't accept your resignation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, more than ever, the country<br/>
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.<br/>
<br/>
We have to do it, César.<br/>
<br/>
You know it. The attorney general,<br/>
the press, the opposition, the citizens,<br/>
<br/>
everyone's looking for someone to blame.<br/>
All of them.<br/>
<br/>
And it's not going to be you.<br/>
<br/>
It's been my honor sewing you<br/>
and the people of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Limon told me you have a daughter.<br/>
<br/>
How old?<br/>
<br/>
- Two.<br/>
- And what's her name?<br/>
<br/>
- Salome.<br/>
- What a beautiful name.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time<br/>
that I've felt indebted to you.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Maritza...<br/>
our daughters will be safe.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Know that... you have a friend in me.<br/>
<br/>
What did you do?<br/>
<br/>
I took care of it.<br/>
<br/>
You're safe now.<br/>
<br/>
What now?<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck do you want?<br/>
<br/>
I want to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Come with me and I'll show you.<br/>
<br/>
Make yourself at home.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Pena.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Montecasino.</div>]","Tata.

Tata. Where is everyone?

Pablo.

- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

I'm all right.

Go back to bed.

Do you know why they brought you there?

He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.

Who is ""he""? Do you remember his name'?

Colonel Carrillo.

I know this is difficult...

but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.

They k*ll my friend.

- I'm very sorry...
- This is a farce.

- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

Colombia is tired of Escobar.

Besides, Valeria Velez?

My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

I need to know if Carrillo
k*ll that boy.

If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

They'll assume ifs the truth.

Exactly.

What do you propose?

That we don't play Escobar`s game.

And that we leave things as they are...
for the time being.

I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

- No. No v*olence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest--

Now we need to have the people
on our side.

Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

Of course.

If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

- Of course.
- Right?

I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

The world has to know what sort of monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

Don Pablo, that's excellent.

Give me that pencil.

Burn everything.

Don't move! Felix, take this one.

Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

We don't know yet. We're working on it.

Are we having a good time?

That's a very pretty girl.

But you're paying for those lines,
assh*le.

Clean this shit up!

Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

And wake up, assh*le!

And you, Edgar!

Call Pablo and ask him
where he wants us to take his half.

All right. All right.

What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

What?

- Have you been calling from this phone?
- No.

Son of a--

Move it, f*g!

Hey there.

Dad?

Quickly, inside!
- Friend.

Calm down, friend.

Everything is all right.

I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

It's carbon rock.

The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

You're going to put chemists
out of business.

I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

Now's the time to move in on Miami.

It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

The Search Bloc is k*ll his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

Could you take care of that?

Yes, of course.

But don't make it too obvious.

I don't want Judy Moncada asking f*cking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

Then you should call Pablo

and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

Guys.

The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.

The sons of bitches k*ll
three of the Prisco brothers.

Ricardo got away.

- When was this?
- Last night,

It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

Since when do we hide, brother?

Let's trust the boss.

Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

- Hello?
- Get me Don Pablo.

- Who is this?
- Fernando Duque.

- Fernando.
- Get him now.

Yes, sir, right away. Limon, please.

Boss?

Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

- How many were published?
- Don Pablo,

we sent all of them to the newspapers.

How many of my letters were published,
Fernando'?

Yes. None.

They're very well written.

It's not about how well written they were,

But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

Excuse me.

- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.

I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

He's back there, looking for you.

If he finds out that I'm here, he's going
to want to k*ll me too. Let's talk. Relax.

Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellin.

- Maritza!
Because of you,

-my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax!

I really am sorry,

Like you helped the girls

You k*ll me by putting me
in your f*cking taxi.

You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

I really am sorry, Maritza.

Believe me. I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

What is it?

We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

- What the f*ck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.

- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

Dona Liliana.

- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

so you can leave with your daughter.

And you? What do you get out of this?

Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're k*ll all of his men.

I'm afraid.

I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

All right. My turn.

You both look beautiful.

All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

Velasco told me.

There are 20 men out there, Tata.

Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

Let's see.

How do you hold it?

What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a g*n?

It's not a joke, Pablo.

Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

All right.

But I think you need
more practice with that.

- Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- Now?

I can't right now. I'm working.

Don't be like that.

All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

Hello.

- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

- Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

Hello.

She's a friend of a friend.

Maritza, meet Javier.

And...

why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

She's in trouble.

Just hear her out.

Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

- Bye!
- No. Wait. It's important.

Please.

Hear her out.

What's your name? Maritza?

What kind of trouble are you in?

Who are you in trouble with?

- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

- He wants to k*ll me.
- Well...

La Quica wants to k*ll a lot of people.

Why does he want to k*ll you?

Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

And how are you going to do that?

I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

If this is true, Colonel, she can tell us
when Limon and Escobar go somewhere.

Let's go.

Can you explain this?

A subpoena.

You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

You mean your witch hunt.

Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

He must have paid someone off.

I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

This is about transparency, truth, law.

And I sense from your reluctance to speak

that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

but we're talking about a national crisis.

So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you'?

Look, sir... I ask you to please trust me.

All you're doing by making
this investigation public

is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

Hello?

Hello, Maritza. It's me.

I spoke with Pena.

Pay attention.

In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar'?

Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

But I need you to trust me.

Give me the address.

Write it down.

9th street with 98-3. Got it?

Got it.

...my love. Do it again.

I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

Thank you, Limon. A kiss.

Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

Everything all right, boss?

9th Street. 98-3.

Okay. Got it.

All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.

We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

Yes, Colonel.

Attention! We're headed out!

We're on San Juan.

Everything's calm.
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.

Of course, Blondie.

It's burning!

Reverse!

It's an ambush!

Sabada!

Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

Son of a bitch!

Look at me.

Look at me.

You asked a child to give me this.

You can have it back.

And this... is for my cousin, Gustavo.

Coward.

Son of a bitch.

Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

They're saying that Pablo himself
k*ll Carrillo.

Next, he'll come after the two of you.

Or me, or you, Pacho.

No, we've got to come up
with another plan.

Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

Pacho, we need to call the Castanos.

Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...
and they're already asking for my head.

They want a scapegoat.

And we have to give them one.

That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

when I entered La Catedral.

And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

I don't accept your resignation.

Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

We have to do it, César.

You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

And it's not going to be you.

It's been my honor sewing you
and the people of Colombia.

Good luck.

Limon told me you have a daughter.

How old?

- Two.
- And what's her name?

- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

Thank you.

Know that... you have a friend in me.

What did you do?

I took care of it.

You're safe now.

What now?

What the f*ck do you want?

I want to help you.

Oh, yeah?

Come with me and I'll show you.

Make yourself at home.

Agent Pena.

Welcome to Montecasino."
02x03 - Our Man in Madrid,"[<div class=""content"">WE LOVE YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Present arms!<br/>
<br/>
I am responsible<br/>
for the death of those men, Eduardo.<br/>
<br/>
And if Escobar is using their deaths<br/>
to send me a message, then I will respond.<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely.<br/>
<br/>
We have to go in full force.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind... bringing him back<br/>
won't be a popular decision.<br/>
<br/>
But since when do we care<br/>
about being popular?<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, they're all saying<br/>
they don't know anything.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
You gentlemen are under the impression<br/>
that you work for the Moncadas.<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to clarify.<br/>
You have never worked for the Moncadas.<br/>
<br/>
You work for me,<br/>
and you have always worked for me.<br/>
<br/>
- Blackie.<br/>
- Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Who gave Judy Moncada<br/>
the cash to buy this house?<br/>
<br/>
You, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Jairo.<br/>
- Yes, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
The money that puts food on the table<br/>
for these men, where does it come from'?<br/>
<br/>
- From your pocket.<br/>
Everything you see here is mine.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you have<br/>
is because I allow you to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you think you are protecting,<br/>
you are protecting for me.<br/>
<br/>
Are we clear on this?<br/>
<br/>
You're going to tell me the location<br/>
of every safe house, every lab,<br/>
<br/>
every office,<br/>
every account of the Moncadas.<br/>
<br/>
And look...<br/>
<br/>
that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly not.<br/>
<br/>
You simply didn't know<br/>
who you were really working for.<br/>
<br/>
So let's begin...<br/>
<br/>
with what's most important.<br/>
<br/>
You're... going to tell me right now...<br/>
<br/>
where that bitch Judy Moncada is hiding.<br/>
<br/>
- Ms. Judy, welcome.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me.<br/>
<br/>
- Hey!<br/>
- Navegante!<br/>
<br/>
- Watch yourself.<br/>
- Mrs. Moncada is our guest.<br/>
<br/>
We treat our guests with respect.<br/>
<br/>
Even the ones who invite themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Pacho,<br/>
are you sure you have enough men?<br/>
<br/>
One might get the impression<br/>
you're scared of someone.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if you took security<br/>
more seriously...<br/>
<br/>
just maybe your husband<br/>
would still be alive...<br/>
<br/>
and you wouldn't be coming to us for help.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to this guy.<br/>
Who told you I was coming here for help?<br/>
<br/>
Where's your boss?<br/>
<br/>
You mean my partner.<br/>
<br/>
- Handling the business.<br/>
- Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
So he's still trying to pretend<br/>
he isn't a drug tr*ffick?<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Moncada...<br/>
why don't you go look around?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, pet the horses.<br/>
<br/>
Or rehearse whatever it is<br/>
you came to say.<br/>
<br/>
Gilberto will be here shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am? Here's what you asked for.<br/>
<br/>
Who's that?<br/>
<br/>
He's one of the new guys.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
POLICE STATION ATTACKED IN MEDELLIN<br/>
<br/>
What a hideous painting.<br/>
<br/>
What a lovely surprise.<br/>
<br/>
- To what do we owe the pleasure?<br/>
Business.<br/>
<br/>
""And one by one, the nights<br/>
between our separated cities,<br/>
<br/>
they are added to the night<br/>
that unites us.""<br/>
<br/>
It's the middle of the f*cking day,<br/>
Gilberto.<br/>
<br/>
Not a fan of Neruda?<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that unites us in this life<br/>
is a desire to see Pablo d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
So tell me, Mrs. Moncada,<br/>
why did you come all this way?<br/>
<br/>
To help you k*ll the man<br/>
who m*rder my husband and brother<br/>
<br/>
by offering very important information<br/>
that only I possess.<br/>
<br/>
- And what is this information?<br/>
- Targets.<br/>
<br/>
The location of every one of his labs.<br/>
<br/>
Going after Pablo`s infrastructure<br/>
will cripple him, force him to surface.<br/>
<br/>
When he does, we put a b*llet in his head<br/>
and we take turns sh1tting on him.<br/>
<br/>
What's valuable isn't knowing<br/>
what Pablo has,<br/>
<br/>
but what he wants to acquire.<br/>
<br/>
Because that's where he'll be next.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo is picking apart your operation<br/>
piece by piece.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what remains<br/>
tells us where he's going.<br/>
<br/>
You want me to tell you where my labs are?<br/>
<br/>
Well... let's say...<br/>
<br/>
that I share that information.<br/>
<br/>
What happens to my labs?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Judy.<br/>
<br/>
Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.<br/>
<br/>
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.<br/>
<br/>
You're right.<br/>
<br/>
He would be very proud of me.<br/>
<br/>
I built the business by his side, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the Medellin cartel.<br/>
I know what I am.<br/>
<br/>
I don't need bullshit an<br/>
hanging on my wall to prove any different.<br/>
<br/>
Wait.<br/>
<br/>
Hold on.<br/>
<br/>
Confronting Pablo directly<br/>
won't help us maintain a low profile.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
what if the Search Bloc were to learn<br/>
the location of your labs?<br/>
<br/>
What good is it if he's arrested?<br/>
<br/>
He's already shown<br/>
he can f*ck us from prison.<br/>
<br/>
This won't end with Pablo in a cell.<br/>
<br/>
You think the police will k*ll him?<br/>
<br/>
There is one officer<br/>
that seems particularly determined.<br/>
<br/>
And President Gaviria<br/>
has arranged for his return.<br/>
<br/>
Assemble the Search Bloc outside.<br/>
I want 100 men and six trucks.<br/>
<br/>
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?<br/>
- On it, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
- They just left. Four motorcycles,<br/>
<br/>
five pickups, and a truck.<br/>
H's a large convex;.<br/>
<br/>
They're heading to Barrio Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs going to get crowded.<br/>
<br/>
The convoy has arrived.<br/>
<br/>
We're in position.<br/>
<br/>
A MAN, A NEIGHBORHOOD, A COUNTRY!<br/>
<br/>
Look. Look up there.<br/>
<br/>
There's something weird happening.<br/>
What do you see?<br/>
<br/>
- They're clouds.<br/>
- No, not clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Because clouds form shapes.<br/>
<br/>
- What I see is a turtle.<br/>
- Boss!<br/>
<br/>
- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.<br/>
- Keep looking.<br/>
<br/>
Keep looking at the clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, sorry to interrupt,<br/>
but it's very important.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on?<br/>
- Carrillo is back.<br/>
<br/>
And he's here in Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
What else?<br/>
<br/>
That son of a bitch filled<br/>
Barrio Escobar with police and...<br/>
<br/>
he pissed on your mural, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Those f*cking cops<br/>
are going up 26th Street.<br/>
<br/>
Copy that, brother. All good.<br/>
<br/>
Trujillo, load up six unmarked cars,<br/>
four men per car.<br/>
<br/>
Instruct them to leave in 20-minute<br/>
intervals to avoid attention. Clear'?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, Colonel.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Freeze! Don't move!<br/>
<br/>
Relax. Everything's good.<br/>
<br/>
What is this?<br/>
<br/>
Pirana down.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
Get him!<br/>
<br/>
Don't move!<br/>
<br/>
Don't move!<br/>
<br/>
- Good evening.<br/>
- Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Would you allow me to search your house?<br/>
We're looking for--<br/>
<br/>
Stop! Stop, boy!<br/>
<br/>
Stop!<br/>
<br/>
Get on the floor!<br/>
<br/>
Show me your hands.<br/>
<br/>
You think you're slick?<br/>
Why were you running'?<br/>
<br/>
No! What did I do wrong?<br/>
<br/>
You tell me what you did.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know who I am?<br/>
<br/>
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
Last week...<br/>
30 police officers were m*rder.<br/>
<br/>
Those pigs probably deserved it.<br/>
<br/>
Many of them were my friends.<br/>
<br/>
A person perched on rooftops,<br/>
guiding m*rder with radios...<br/>
<br/>
are assassins themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I hope after this encounter,<br/>
you'll reconsider<br/>
<br/>
working with someone<br/>
who thinks he's above the law.<br/>
<br/>
What? Am I supposed to<br/>
shit in my pants in feat'?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Do I make myself clear?<br/>
<br/>
I want you to tell your friends,<br/>
<br/>
that this is what happens<br/>
when you work for Pablo Escobar!<br/>
<br/>
Take it.<br/>
<br/>
Take it.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them this is for Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Remember what you saw.<br/>
<br/>
And know what will happen to you<br/>
if I see you on a rooftop.<br/>
<br/>
You can leave.<br/>
<br/>
Leave!<br/>
<br/>
So, what book shall we read<br/>
before bed tonight?<br/>
<br/>
The Witch.<br/>
<br/>
No, my love. No scary stories.<br/>
<br/>
The Witch? What's that? I don't know it.<br/>
<br/>
Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?<br/>
<br/>
- The bad witch and the good witch, right?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Not The Witch, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want any more scary stories<br/>
in this house.<br/>
<br/>
Love, take your sister<br/>
and brush your teeth.<br/>
<br/>
And go straight to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, where's my kiss?<br/>
<br/>
Good night.<br/>
<br/>
- Good night, my love.<br/>
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.<br/>

<br/>
I heard a scary story, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
The man who k*ll Gustavo<br/>
is back in Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
Is that story true?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound like the government<br/>
is trying to negotiate?<br/>
<br/>
Good night.<br/>
<br/>
Someone has to tell you<br/>
how things are, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
That man is here to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm scared, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I promise you one thing:<br/>
<br/>
if things get out of hand<br/>
and I can't control it...<br/>
<br/>
we'll leave the country.<br/>
<br/>
O Kay?<br/>
<br/>
- Have you seen this woman?<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
She works at the market.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetheart?<br/>
<br/>
- Are you sure?<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody’s seen the bitch.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pissed off, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go for some ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Something cold.<br/>
<br/>
You were different this time, Javi.<br/>
<br/>
I always know when my clients<br/>
are trying to forget something.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I do to relax?<br/>
<br/>
- I write.<br/>
- You write?<br/>
<br/>
- What do you write?<br/>
- Letters.<br/>
<br/>
For my family, but I never send them.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs good to forget.<br/>
<br/>
What do you want to forget?<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you stop?<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you?<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, brother.<br/>
<br/>
This way.<br/>
<br/>
- What is your name?<br/>
- David.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.<br/>
Pleasure to meet you, too.<br/>
<br/>
Follow me.<br/>
<br/>
They told me you like soccer.<br/>
<br/>
- I play defense.<br/>
- Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the real men.<br/>
<br/>
You're very brave, David.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for what you witnessed.<br/>
<br/>
The people we're fighting<br/>
are very bad people.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me about the man who did that.<br/>
<br/>
He said this b*llet is for you.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to do one last favor for me.<br/>
<br/>
It's very important.<br/>
<br/>
You think you can do it?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, David.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Pena. This is Don Berna.<br/>
<br/>
§ have a proposition<br/>
you might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
What a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
What's up, Pena?<br/>
Are you expecting anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
No. Are you?<br/>
<br/>
No, it's not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I go in this town,<br/>
I'm surrounded by friends.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down. Sit so you can taste<br/>
the best coffee in Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
Dona Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.<br/>
<br/>
You have something<br/>
other than coffee for me?<br/>
<br/>
Look, Agent... I'm not one of those<br/>
street-corner informants<br/>
<br/>
that you slip a few gringo dollars<br/>
for a tip. No, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Then why are we here?<br/>
<br/>
Agent, you and I<br/>
are like the snake and the cat.<br/>
<br/>
If the snake has the chance,<br/>
it will k*ll the cat.<br/>
<br/>
And if the cat has the chance,<br/>
it will k*ll the snake.<br/>
<br/>
But there are times<br/>
when they see a big rat,<br/>
<br/>
and they both want to eat it.<br/>
<br/>
Gato!<br/>
<br/>
No! Calm down.<br/>
Okay, relax. Don't k*ll me-<br/>
<br/>
Relax!<br/>

Detaining the prisoners.<br/>
<br/>
We captured about 45 of them.<br/>
<br/>
Approaching.<br/>
<br/>
We're locking you up.<br/>
<br/>
Move it!<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
- I didn't realize you'd be here.<br/>
- I wanted to be sure it went well.<br/>
<br/>
- People need to hear the truth, right?<br/>
- Yes, ifs important.<br/>
<br/>
They forced this boy<br/>
to watch his friend get sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
When the country hears this story,<br/>
they'll turn on that son of a bitch<br/>
<br/>
who's m*rder children<br/>
for the Americans.<br/>
<br/>
Well... that's what I hope.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you came.<br/>
<br/>
It's good to see you again.<br/>
<br/>
Are all eyes still on you?<br/>
<br/>
Except yours.<br/>
<br/>
Let's begin.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
- How old are you?<br/>
- Ten.<br/>
<br/>
I understand you're quite a soccer player.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for being brave enough<br/>
to tell us your story, David.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, who were the men<br/>
who brought you to the building that day?<br/>
<br/>
They were Search Bloc policemen.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know why they brought you there?<br/>
<br/>
He said they were going<br/>
to send a message to other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Who is ""he""? Do you remember his name'?<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.<br/>
<br/>
- Where are you taking us?<br/>
- Bogoté.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to jail<br/>
until this gets resolved.<br/>
<br/>
But look...<br/>
if you help me, I can help you.<br/>
<br/>
Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,<br/>
then I'll help you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where they are.<br/>
I don't know them.<br/>
<br/>
- So you don't know anything?<br/>
- No, sir.<br/>
<br/>
What about you, Gato?<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
If it's going to be like this...<br/>
<br/>
Who else was there<br/>
besides Colonel Carrillo?<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of men.<br/>
<br/>
Some I heard speaking English.<br/>
Americans. Like in the movies.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure they were police?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
What now?<br/>
<br/>
You think Pablo is going to reward you<br/>
for being brave?<br/>
<br/>
assh*le, he doesn't even know you exist.<br/>
Do you know that?<br/>
<br/>
Ifs your last chance, Gato.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!<br/>
<br/>
- Hello.<br/>
Everything is good.<br/>
<br/>
- It worked.<br/>
- Very well.<br/>
<br/>
It worked.<br/>
<br/>
- They took my lab.<br/>
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.<br/>
<br/>
It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.<br/>
<br/>
Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'<br/>
biggest lab before we could take it apart.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo got Gate. We don't know where<br/>
they are or what they're doing to him.</div>]","WE LOVE YOU!

Present arms!

I am responsible
for the death of those men, Eduardo.

And if Escobar is using their deaths
to send me a message, then I will respond.

I agree completely.

We have to go in full force.

Keep in mind... bringing him back
won't be a popular decision.

But since when do we care
about being popular?

Colonel Carrillo.

Yes, Mr. President.

Boss, they're all saying
they don't know anything.

There seems to be a misunderstanding.

You gentlemen are under the impression
that you work for the Moncadas.

Allow me to clarify.
You have never worked for the Moncadas.

You work for me,
and you have always worked for me.

- Blackie.
- Yes, boss.

Who gave Judy Moncada
the cash to buy this house?

You, Don Pablo.

- Jairo.
- Yes, Don Pablo.

The money that puts food on the table
for these men, where does it come from'?

- From your pocket.
Everything you see here is mine.

Everything you have
is because I allow you to have it.

Everything you think you are protecting,
you are protecting for me.

Are we clear on this?

You're going to tell me the location
of every safe house, every lab,

every office,
every account of the Moncadas.

And look...

that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.

Certainly not.

You simply didn't know
who you were really working for.

So let's begin...

with what's most important.

You're... going to tell me right now...

where that bitch Judy Moncada is hiding.

- Ms. Judy, welcome.
- Thank you.

Pardon me.

- Hey!
- Navegante!

- Watch yourself.
- Mrs. Moncada is our guest.

We treat our guests with respect.

Even the ones who invite themselves.

Listen, Pacho,
are you sure you have enough men?

One might get the impression
you're scared of someone.

Perhaps if you took security
more seriously...

just maybe your husband
would still be alive...

and you wouldn't be coming to us for help.

Listen to this guy.
Who told you I was coming here for help?

Where's your boss?

You mean my partner.

- Handling the business.
- Is that right?

So he's still trying to pretend
he isn't a drug tr*ffick?

Mrs. Moncada...
why don't you go look around?

I don't know, pet the horses.

Or rehearse whatever it is
you came to say.

Gilberto will be here shortly.

Thank you, Pacho.

Ma'am? Here's what you asked for.

Who's that?

He's one of the new guys.

Excuse me.

POLICE STATION ATTACKED IN MEDELLIN

What a hideous painting.

What a lovely surprise.

- To what do we owe the pleasure?
Business.

""And one by one, the nights
between our separated cities,

they are added to the night
that unites us.""

It's the middle of the f*cking day,
Gilberto.

Not a fan of Neruda?

The only thing that unites us in this life
is a desire to see Pablo d*ad.

Gentlemen.

So tell me, Mrs. Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

To help you k*ll the man
who m*rder my husband and brother

by offering very important information
that only I possess.

- And what is this information?
- Targets.

The location of every one of his labs.

Going after Pablo`s infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

When he does, we put a b*llet in his head
and we take turns sh1tting on him.

What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

but what he wants to acquire.

Because that's where he'll be next.

Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

You want me to tell you where my labs are?

Well... let's say...

that I share that information.

What happens to my labs?

Oh, Judy.

Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.

Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

You're right.

He would be very proud of me.

I built the business by his side, Pacho.

I'm from the Medellin cartel.
I know what I am.

I don't need bullshit an
hanging on my wall to prove any different.

Wait.

Hold on.

Confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

But...

what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

What good is it if he's arrested?

He's already shown
he can f*ck us from prison.

This won't end with Pablo in a cell.

You think the police will k*ll him?

There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

Assemble the Search Bloc outside.
I want 100 men and six trucks.

- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

- What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

five pickups, and a truck.
H's a large convex;.

They're heading to Barrio Escobar.

Ifs going to get crowded.

The convoy has arrived.

We're in position.

A MAN, A NEIGHBORHOOD, A COUNTRY!

Look. Look up there.

There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

- They're clouds.
- No, not clouds.

Because clouds form shapes.

- What I see is a turtle.
- Boss!

- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.
- Keep looking.

Keep looking at the clouds.

Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

- What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

And he's here in Medellin.

What else?

That son of a bitch filled
Barrio Escobar with police and...

he pissed on your mural, sir.

Those f*cking cops
are going up 26th Street.

Copy that, brother. All good.

Trujillo, load up six unmarked cars,
four men per car.

Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear'?

- Yes, Colonel.
- Okay.

Freeze! Don't move!

Relax. Everything's good.

What is this?

Pirana down.

Son of a bitch.

Where are you going?

Get him!

Don't move!

Don't move!

- Good evening.
- Yes?

Would you allow me to search your house?
We're looking for--

Stop! Stop, boy!

Stop!

Get on the floor!

Show me your hands.

You think you're slick?
Why were you running'?

No! What did I do wrong?

You tell me what you did.

Do you know who I am?

My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

Last week...
30 police officers were m*rder.

Those pigs probably deserved it.

Many of them were my friends.

A person perched on rooftops,
guiding m*rder with radios...

are assassins themselves.

I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

working with someone
who thinks he's above the law.

What? Am I supposed to
shit in my pants in feat'?

No.

Do I make myself clear?

I want you to tell your friends,

that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

Take it.

Take it.

Tell them this is for Pablo.

Remember what you saw.

And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

You can leave.

Leave!

So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

The Witch.

No, my love. No scary stories.

The Witch? What's that? I don't know it.

Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?

- The bad witch and the good witch, right?
- Yes.

Not The Witch, Pablo.

I don't want any more scary stories
in this house.

Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

And go straight to bed.

Listen, where's my kiss?

Good night.

- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

I heard a scary story, Pablo.

The man who k*ll Gustavo
is back in Medellin.

Is that story true?

Yes.

Does that sound like the government
is trying to negotiate?

Good night.

Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

That man is here to k*ll you.

I'm scared, Pablo.

I promise you one thing:

if things get out of hand
and I can't control it...

we'll leave the country.

O Kay?

- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

She works at the market.

Sweetheart?

- Are you sure?
- No.

Nobody’s seen the bitch.

I'm pissed off, brother.

Let's go for some ice cream.

Something cold.

You were different this time, Javi.

I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

You know what I do to relax?

- I write.
- You write?

- What do you write?
- Letters.

For my family, but I never send them.

Ifs good to forget.

What do you want to forget?

Why don't you stop?

Why don't you?

Welcome, brother.

This way.

- What is your name?
- David.

- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you, too.

Follow me.

They told me you like soccer.

- I play defense.
- Of course.

Those are the real men.

You're very brave, David.

I'm sorry for what you witnessed.

The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

Tell me about the man who did that.

He said this b*llet is for you.

I need you to do one last favor for me.

It's very important.

You think you can do it?

Thank you, David.

Agent Pena. This is Don Berna.

§ have a proposition
you might be interested in.

What a surprise.

What's up, Pena?
Are you expecting anyone else?

No. Are you?

No, it's not necessary.

Everywhere I go in this town,
I'm surrounded by friends.

Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellin.

Dona Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

You have something
other than coffee for me?

Look, Agent... I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

Then why are we here?

Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the cat.

If the snake has the chance,
it will k*ll the cat.

And if the cat has the chance,
it will k*ll the snake.

But there are times
when they see a big rat,

and they both want to eat it.

Gato!

No! Calm down.
Okay, relax. Don't k*ll me-

Relax!

Detaining the prisoners.

We captured about 45 of them.

Approaching.

We're locking you up.

Move it!

Hello, Valeria.

- I didn't realize you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

- People need to hear the truth, right?
- Yes, ifs important.

They forced this boy
to watch his friend get sh*t.

When the country hears this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

who's m*rder children
for the Americans.

Well... that's what I hope.

I'm glad you came.

It's good to see you again.

Are all eyes still on you?

Except yours.

Let's begin.

Yes.

- How old are you?
- Ten.

I understand you're quite a soccer player.

Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

Tell me, who were the men
who brought you to the building that day?

They were Search Bloc policemen.

Do you know why they brought you there?

He said they were going
to send a message to other kids.

Who is ""he""? Do you remember his name'?

Colonel Carrillo.

Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

- Where are you taking us?
- Bogoté.

You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,
then I'll help you.

I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

What about you, Gato?

All right.

If it's going to be like this...

Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?

A bunch of men.

Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

Are you sure they were police?

Yes.

What now?

You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

assh*le, he doesn't even know you exist.
Do you know that?

Ifs your last chance, Gato.

Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

- Hello.
Everything is good.

- It worked.
- Very well.

It worked.

- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.

Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

Carrillo got Gate. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him."

It had to be that whore in the market.<br/>
Please, Quica!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for accepting the invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me for the hood.<br/>

<br/>
Can I offer you something? Coffee, water?<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm fine, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Let's begin, then.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?<br/>
Absolutely not. In fact...<br/>
<br/>
what I regret least is having escaped.<br/>
<br/>
The Special Forces came in<br/>
and opened f*re.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't risk putting my life<br/>
in their hands, right?<br/>
<br/>
However...<br/>
<br/>
I hope this interview<br/>
makes it clear to the president...<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to return to any prison<br/>
in the District of Antioquia.<br/>
<br/>
The most modest and the most humble.<br/>
<br/>
But before that, I have to examine<br/>
the conditions they are going to put me in<br/>
<br/>
because, look, it would be easy,<br/>
for example, for someone to rig a car b*mb<br/>
<br/>
that would explode when I arrived.<br/>
<br/>
ll turns out that my problem<br/>
turned into a political problem.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that I am very important<br/>
<br/>
to the re-election<br/>
of the president of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
I will always be ready to pay for<br/>
my mistakes and accept a humble jail cell<br/>
<br/>
when my rights are respected<br/>
<br/>
and they guarantee me that I will not<br/>
be transferred anywhere for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
Do you acknowledge that<br/>
you have committed crimes in the past,<br/>
<br/>
or that you ordered someones death?<br/>
<br/>
That answer one could<br/>
only give to a priest.<br/>
<br/>
In a confessional.<br/>
<br/>
Marietta.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
- What happened?<br/>
<br/>
It looks like they k*ll them.<br/>
I think there were six or seven girls.<br/>
<br/>
Who would do something so horrible?<br/>
<br/>
Are you, by nature, violent and proud?<br/>
<br/>
Those who know me<br/>
know I have a great sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that I'm a happy man.<br/>
<br/>
I've always been happy.<br/>
I've always been optimistic.<br/>
<br/>
I've always had faith in life.<br/>
<br/>
I always sing in the shower.<br/>
<br/>
How do you think the story<br/>
of Pablo Escobar will end?<br/>
<br/>
Well... one can never know.<br/>
I can only hope for the best.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to die on my own two feet.<br/>

In the year 3047.<br/>

You have to get it.<br/>

Boss, excuse the interruption.<br/>
One moment, please.<br/>

Haw do you""?<br/>
<br/>
What about the laboratories?<br/>
<br/>
It's been difficult<br/>
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.<br/>
<br/>
And the ones that we find,<br/>
we can't get inside.<br/>
<br/>
There are police checkpoints everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
We lost four men<br/>
trying to get through one.<br/>
<br/>
Sons of bitches.<br/>
<br/>
And what about Judy Moncada?<br/>
<br/>
We can't find her anywhere. Or Don Berna.<br/>
<br/>
Find her.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
And you, boys?<br/>
<br/>
Everything is good, boss.<br/>
<br/>
- How are you, Limon?<br/>
- Very good, sir.<br/>

<br/>
Good.<br/>

I'm going to teach you something.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing lower than a rat.<br/>
<br/>
And if we let the rats run free,<br/>
the streets will be filled with them.<br/>
<br/>
Understand me?<br/>
- Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Give me one second. One second.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
- Tell me, Fernando.<br/>
- Your interview clearly worked, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Palacio wants to meet with me right away.<br/>
<br/>
You heard that, brother?<br/>
<br/>
- We have to finish our little job.<br/>
- But we already finished it, right?<br/>
<br/>
No, brother, there's still one left.<br/>
<br/>
But you already k*ll all the whores.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not talking about whores, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Why her?<br/>
<br/>
- She did everything we told her to.<br/>
- Someone talked to the police.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it was those f*cking whores.<br/>
<br/>
She is someone I can trust, man.<br/>
<br/>
You can trust her, but I can't.<br/>
<br/>
Move it.<br/>
<br/>
Quica.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to tell you again, brother.<br/>
And we've got some shit we gotta do first.<br/>
<br/>
Good day.<br/>
<br/>
I have a meeting with the president.<br/>
<br/>
I am Fernando Duque.<br/>
<br/>
Your meeting is not<br/>
with the president, Mr. Duque.<br/>
<br/>
How's that?<br/>
<br/>
- With the vice minister, then?<br/>
- No, sir.<br/>
<br/>
The information I have here says<br/>
your meeting is with the attorney general.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies, Mr. Duque.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Duque...<br/>
<br/>
I believe the whole world<br/>
has the right to a fair trial.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar has the same rights<br/>
as any other Colombian.<br/>
<br/>
If he has committed a crime,<br/>
he must be judged and indicted.<br/>
<br/>
He can't be hunted and k*ll<br/>
like an animal.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. De Greiff,<br/>
<br/>
everything you're telling me I find...<br/>
fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don't--<br/>
<br/>
I don't buckle under the pressure<br/>
of the Americans...<br/>
<br/>
like Gaviria, Mr. Duque.<br/>
<br/>
Then that means that...<br/>
<br/>
you would consider...<br/>
making a deal with Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I am saying that Colombia...<br/>
<br/>
has been at w*r far too long.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
The Americans are bringing in new people.<br/>
<br/>
Different faces but, ultimately,<br/>
with the same motivation.<br/>
<br/>
They are using us<br/>
to advance their political agenda.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
But the reality is we have to accept help<br/>
wherever it comes from.<br/>
<br/>
And right now,<br/>
the gringos are very limited,<br/>
<br/>
confined to Carlos Holguin<br/>
and the embassy.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Pablo Escobar<br/>
is gaining ground, gathering more support.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is helping him in Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
- A long manhunt plays into his hands.<br/>
- Let's talk about Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Pinzén basically<br/>
has Escobar surrounded.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think we'll succeed?<br/>
<br/>
Tip line. What do you want to report?<br/>
<br/>
Agent Pena?<br/>
<br/>
Pansies!<br/>
<br/>
Attorney General De Greiff.<br/>
<br/>
They told me that you met<br/>
with Mr. Fernando Duque.<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
The president was very clear<br/>
<br/>
when he said that no one<br/>
was to communicate with Escobar's people.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for the president,<br/>
I don't work for him.<br/>
<br/>
I work for the people of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And, just like the president,<br/>
I also work for the people of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And we are all working together,<br/>
in a united front, against Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
- This isn't a single w*r--<br/>
- Are you afraid of what I might find<br/>
<br/>
if I speak with him, Mr. Sandoval?<br/>
<br/>
- Excuse me?<br/>
- Tell me something.<br/>
<br/>
Why did you need to be there<br/>
that night at La Catedral?<br/>
<br/>
Why was the presence of<br/>
the vice minister of justice necessary<br/>
<br/>
to transfer a prisoner?<br/>
<br/>
Because were not talking about<br/>
any prisoner, Attorney General.<br/>
<br/>
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
And I was only following the orders<br/>
of the president.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that's true.<br/>
<br/>
Are you insinuating something,<br/>
Attorney General?<br/>
<br/>
- Are you accusing me of something?<br/>
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.<br/>
<br/>
At least, not yet.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm going to open up an investigation.<br/>
<br/>
About the allegations...<br/>
<br/>
that, possibly,<br/>
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.<br/>
<br/>
You know what, Attorney General?<br/>
<br/>
Eat shit.<br/>
<br/>
- What the hell are we doing here?<br/>
- Running an errand, brother.<br/>
<br/>
- What errand?<br/>
- For Don Pablo, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, gentlemen,<br/>
can I help you with something?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up<br/>
a package, under the name Alvarez.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Brother... let's give up on the girl.<br/>
She's not coming back.<br/>
<br/>
Are you afraid or what, Limon?<br/>
<br/>
Close your f*cking mouth<br/>
and do what I say.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Alvarez!<br/>
<br/>
Quica!<br/>
<br/>
This is the best toilet they make.<br/>
You really know your shit.<br/>
<br/>
Brother!<br/>
<br/>
That's what I'm talking about, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
Boys, put it in the car.<br/>
We've got some business to take care of.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to take out her eyes<br/>
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.<br/>
<br/>
- What number?<br/>
- Room three. I already told you.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch. You told me<br/>
that she was going to be here.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, brother.<br/>
I think this is where she lives.<br/>
<br/>
She's not there.<br/>
Anyway, tomorrow is better.<br/>
<br/>
We'll come back later.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck that, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Quica!<br/>
<br/>
Over there, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I got something, brother.<br/>
<br/>
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her<br/>
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I told you she wasn't here.<br/>
At this hour, she's already working.<br/>
<br/>
- This is bullshit, brother.<br/>
- She's not here.<br/>
<br/>
We'll come back later, then.<br/>
<br/>
If the president<br/>
doesn't agree with the deal,<br/>
<br/>
then we haven't won anything. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, we have found a very good option.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
If you allow me to negotiate<br/>
with De Greiff<br/>
<br/>
-and create some dissention in the ranks--<br/>
- Oh, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
You pay me to strategize<br/>
and that's exactly what I am doing.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, you have to understand...<br/>
<br/>
The moment- The position<br/>
that Gaviria is in right now--<br/>
<br/>
What happened at La Catedral<br/>
was a humiliating failure for him.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, he's thinking<br/>
that capturing you is his only option.<br/>
<br/>
And he's not thinking about<br/>
<br/>
trying to find some way<br/>
to speak with us, but...<br/>
<br/>
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.<br/>
<br/>
And he has the autonomy to make deals.<br/>
<br/>
Fine, okay.<br/>
<br/>
Let's try it.<br/>
<br/>
You're not going to believe it,<br/>
but the attorney general<br/>
<br/>
supports the legalization of drugs.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't bullshit me.<br/>
- It's true.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,<br/>
with patience, with time--<br/>
<br/>
What we don't have is time, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
Fernando, excuse us.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Blackie.<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you very much.<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
We can't live like this, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Running from one place to another, hiding,<br/>
<br/>
hoping the government wants to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.<br/>
<br/>
How are you so calm?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail<br/>
then we know perfectly well what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
I think ifs time for us<br/>
to leave Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
I know we agreed we would never leave,<br/>
but things have changed.<br/>
<br/>
No, nothing has changed.<br/>
<br/>
My love, we have everything we need.<br/>
<br/>
Let's get the children<br/>
and go to some other place.<br/>
<br/>
A place where we don't have to hide.<br/>
<br/>
We're not going to<br/>
spend our lives in hiding.<br/>
<br/>
I promise you that.<br/>
<br/>
Ortiz, don't let him<br/>
out of your sight. Over.<br/>
<br/>
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.<br/>
<br/>
Not just any toilet.<br/>
<br/>
The same one that Pablo had<br/>
at La Catedral. A Kohler.<br/>
<br/>
We need more.<br/>
<br/>
- But what else, Pena?<br/>
- Where did they see him?<br/>
<br/>
Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, when are you coming?<br/>
You left me all alone.<br/>
<br/>
I can't right now. It's too dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
But you said you were coming.<br/>
<br/>
Let things calm down a little bit.<br/>
I'll show you a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong...<br/>
<br/>
In the last raid,<br/>
your two men managed to capture<br/>
<br/>
the president of the United States,<br/>
George Bush.<br/>
<br/>
That was based on many different calls<br/>
from the tip line.<br/>
<br/>
This is the voice of Velasco.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Messina, apparently<br/>
you think my men work for you.<br/>
<br/>
You are mistaken. I don't work for you.<br/>
<br/>
I decide how we are going<br/>
to work together. Is that clear?<br/>
<br/>
And I already know what happened<br/>
to the last man that worked with you.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
He was exiled to Spain.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
General?<br/>
<br/>
Move your asses! The police are coming!<br/>
<br/>
Get the cars and the money ready<br/>
right now. They're close, now!<br/>
<br/>
Boss!<br/>
<br/>
Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.<br/>
<br/>
Boss.<br/>
<br/>
It's the police.<br/>
<br/>
They're coming up the hill.<br/>
We have to leave right now, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo. Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Sons of bitches.<br/>
<br/>
They're coming from<br/>
the other side too, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- What happened?<br/>
- We have to leave right now.<br/>
<br/>
The police are coming.<br/>
<br/>
- Get the cars ready.<br/>
- Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
- Wait out back.<br/>
- Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Go get the kids.<br/>
We have to leave right now.<br/>
<br/>
Come this way. Hurry up!<br/>
<br/>
Hurry. Over here, through the tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
Surround the house! Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
They're gone, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel, nobody's in the house,<br/>
no signs of life, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Shit.<br/>
<br/>
At ease.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead, come in.<br/>
<br/>
The bedrooms...<br/>
<br/>
they're on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is okay, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
No, Pablo.<br/>
This time everything is not okay.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetheart, if Pablo<br/>
says everything is okay,<br/>
<br/>
-it's because everything is--<br/>
- Was I talking to you?<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking to my husband.<br/>
<br/>
That was very close, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
And tomorrow, what?<br/>
<br/>
Do you want your children<br/>
to watch those men k*ll you?<br/>
<br/>
No one is going to die, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
I am dealing with it.<br/>
<br/>
How, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how.<br/>
<br/>
Negotiating?<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, they nearly k*ll you<br/>
for negotiating.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to fix everything,<br/>
fix it for good.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
Ready.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, everybody is ready.<br/>
What's the order?<br/>
<br/>
Do it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
- Ready.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
We're ready, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Come.<br/>
<br/>
Step on it!<br/>
<br/>
Do it, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs cold, you f*cking f*g!<br/>
<br/>
k*ll him! Do it, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
k*ll him!</div>]","Get down!

One!

Rosa!

Tell me who talked to the police!
Who talked to them'?

It had to be that whore in the market.
Please, Quica!

Thanks for accepting the invitation.

Forgive me for the hood.

Ifs for security reasons.

- I hope you understand.
- I understand.

Can I offer you something? Coffee, water?

No, I'm fine, thank you.

Let's begin, then.

- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?
Absolutely not. In fact...

what I regret least is having escaped.

The Special Forces came in
and opened f*re.

I couldn't risk putting my life
in their hands, right?

However...

I hope this interview
makes it clear to the president...

I am willing to return to any prison
in the District of Antioquia.

The most modest and the most humble.

But before that, I have to examine
the conditions they are going to put me in

because, look, it would be easy,
for example, for someone to rig a car b*mb

that would explode when I arrived.

ll turns out that my problem
turned into a political problem.

It appears that I am very important

to the re-election
of the president of the United States.

I will always be ready to pay for
my mistakes and accept a humble jail cell

when my rights are respected

and they guarantee me that I will not
be transferred anywhere for any reason.

Do you acknowledge that
you have committed crimes in the past,

or that you ordered someones death?

That answer one could
only give to a priest.

In a confessional.

Marietta.

- What's up?
- What happened?

It looks like they k*ll them.
I think there were six or seven girls.

Who would do something so horrible?

Are you, by nature, violent and proud?

Those who know me
know I have a great sense of humor.

I would say that I'm a happy man.

I've always been happy.
I've always been optimistic.

I've always had faith in life.

I always sing in the shower.

How do you think the story
of Pablo Escobar will end?

Well... one can never know.
I can only hope for the best.

I would like to die on my own two feet.

In the year 3047.

Look behind you. Watch out for that guy.

That's it.

Smash the telephone booth.

Get the pipe.

I already know, Dad.

You have to get it.

And what's that, a woman?

I'm about to fight a woman or what?

- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what`s her name?

Nora.

Boss, excuse the interruption.
One moment, please.

Haw do you""?

What about the laboratories?

It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

There are police checkpoints everywhere.

We lost four men
trying to get through one.

Sons of bitches.

And what about Judy Moncada?

We can't find her anywhere. Or Don Berna.

Find her.

Yes, sir.

And you, boys?

Everything is good, boss.

- How are you, Limon?
- Very good, sir.

- How are you feeling?
- Very good, boss.

Comfortable?
- Thank you. Very good.

Good.

I'm going to teach you something.

There is nothing lower than a rat.

And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

Give me one second. One second.

Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

- Tell me, Fernando.
- Your interview clearly worked, Don Pablo.

Palacio wants to meet with me right away.

You heard that, brother?

- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

No, brother, there's still one left.

But you already k*ll all the whores.

I'm not talking about whores, brother.

Why her?

- She did everything we told her to.
- Someone talked to the police.

Yeah, it was those f*cking whores.

She is someone I can trust, man.

You can trust her, but I can't.

Move it.

Quica.

I'm not going to tell you again, brother.
And we've got some shit we gotta do first.

Good day.

I have a meeting with the president.

I am Fernando Duque.

Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr. Duque.

How's that?

- With the vice minister, then?
- No, sir.

The information I have here says
your meeting is with the attorney general.

My apologies, Mr. Duque.

Mr. Duque...

I believe the whole world
has the right to a fair trial.

Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

He can't be hunted and k*ll
like an animal.

Mr. De Greiff,

everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

However, I don't--

I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

like Gaviria, Mr. Duque.

Then that means that...

you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

I am saying that Colombia...

has been at w*r far too long.

Of course.

The Americans are bringing in new people.

Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

Perhaps.

But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

And right now,
the gringos are very limited,

confined to Carlos Holguin
and the embassy.

On the other hand, Pablo Escobar
is gaining ground, gathering more support.

Everyone is helping him in Medellin.

- A long manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellin.

Colonel Pinzén basically
has Escobar surrounded.

Do you think we'll succeed?

Tip line. What do you want to report?

Agent Pena?

Pansies!

Attorney General De Greiff.

They told me that you met
with Mr. Fernando Duque.

That's right.

The president was very clear

when he said that no one
was to communicate with Escobar's people.

Unfortunately for the president,
I don't work for him.

I work for the people of Colombia.

And, just like the president,
I also work for the people of Colombia.

And we are all working together,
in a united front, against Escobar.

- This isn't a single w*r--
- Are you afraid of what I might find

if I speak with him, Mr. Sandoval?

- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

to transfer a prisoner?

Because were not talking about
any prisoner, Attorney General.

We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

And I was only following the orders
of the president.

I don't think that's true.

Are you insinuating something,
Attorney General?

- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

At least, not yet.

But I'm going to open up an investigation.

About the allegations...

that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

You know what, Attorney General?

Eat shit.

- What the hell are we doing here?
- Running an errand, brother.

- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

Hello.

Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you with something?

Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

Yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

Go ahead.

Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back.

Are you afraid or what, Limon?

Close your f*cking mouth
and do what I say.

Mr. Alvarez!

Quica!

This is the best toilet they make.
You really know your shit.

Brother!

That's what I'm talking about, brother.

Good.

Boys, put it in the car.
We've got some business to take care of.

I am going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

Son of a bitch. You told me
that she was going to be here.

I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

She's not there.
Anyway, tomorrow is better.

We'll come back later.

f*ck that, brother.

Quica!

Over there, brother.

I got something, brother.

That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

I told you she wasn't here.
At this hour, she's already working.

- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

We'll come back later, then.

If the president
doesn't agree with the deal,

then we haven't won anything. Right?

Pablo, we have found a very good option.

Definitely.

If you allow me to negotiate
with De Greiff

-and create some dissention in the ranks--
- Oh, Fernando.

That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

You pay me to strategize
and that's exactly what I am doing.

Pablo, you have to understand...

The moment- The position
that Gaviria is in right now--

What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

And he's not thinking about

trying to find some way
to speak with us, but...

De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

And he has the autonomy to make deals.

Fine, okay.

Let's try it.

You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

supports the legalization of drugs.

- Don't bullshit me.
- It's true.

Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time--

What we don't have is time, Fernando.

Fernando, excuse us.

- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

- Blackie.
- Yes, sir.

Thank you very much, Fernando.

- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

Excuse me.

What's wrong?

We can't live like this, Pablo.

Running from one place to another, hiding,

hoping the government wants to negotiate.

Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

How are you so calm?

Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we know perfectly well what he wants.

I think ifs time for us
to leave Colombia.

I know we agreed we would never leave,
but things have changed.

No, nothing has changed.

My love, we have everything we need.

Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

A place where we don't have to hide.

We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

I promise you that.

Ortiz, don't let him
out of your sight. Over.

They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

Not just any toilet.

The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

We need more.

- But what else, Pena?
- Where did they see him?

Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.

Baby, when are you coming?
You left me all alone.

I can't right now. It's too dangerous.

But you said you were coming.

Let things calm down a little bit.
I'll show you a good time.

Correct me if I'm wrong...

In the last raid,
your two men managed to capture

the president of the United States,
George Bush.

That was based on many different calls
from the tip line.

This is the voice of Velasco.

Ms. Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

You are mistaken. I don't work for you.

I decide how we are going
to work together. Is that clear?

And I already know what happened
to the last man that worked with you.

Colonel Carrillo.

He was exiled to Spain.

Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

Excuse me, Colonel.

General?

Move your asses! The police are coming!

Get the cars and the money ready
right now. They're close, now!

Boss!

Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.

Boss.

It's the police.

They're coming up the hill.
We have to leave right now, boss.

Pablo. Pablo!

Sons of bitches.

They're coming from
the other side too, sir.

- What happened?
- We have to leave right now.

The police are coming.

- Get the cars ready.
- Yes, boss.

- Wait out back.
- Yes, boss.

How, Pablo?

Tell me how.

If you are going to fix everything,
fix it for good.

Don't worry.

Ready.

Boss, everybody is ready.
What's the order?

Do it.

Yes, sir.

- What's up?
- Ready.

All right.

We're ready, sir.

Come.

Step on it!

Do it, brother.

Ifs cold, you f*cking f*g!

k*ll him! Do it, bitch!

k*ll him!"
02x01 - Free at Last,"[<div class=""content"">Hey, Jimenez...<br/>
<br/>
Do you think<br/>
the Special Forces guys k*ll him'?<br/>
<br/>
If he can even be k*ll, that is.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean?<br/>
What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
I heard they sh*t him 20 times.<br/>
<br/>
They pumped him full of lead.<br/>
<br/>
Then they b*rned his body<br/>
and spread his ashes all over Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
They say that he rose from the ashes,<br/>
<br/>
and he went to the houses<br/>
of each of the men who had sh*t him,<br/>
<br/>
and he k*ll them as they slept.<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Quiet! Someone's coming.<br/>
<br/>
We're soldiers from the National Army!<br/>
<br/>
Stop and identify yourselves!<br/>
<br/>
We're well armed!<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered<br/>
to not let you through.<br/>
<br/>
We have to take you into custody.<br/>
<br/>
Son, I'm sorry to say...<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately,<br/>
I can't allow that to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
You don't speak a word of this to anyone,<br/>
understood?<br/>
<br/>
This...<br/>
<br/>
is an enormous embarrassment<br/>
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
-how will we proceed?<br/>
- Mr. President...<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt<br/>
to reestablish himself within the city,<br/>
<br/>
and we can't allow him and his sicarios<br/>
to move freely.<br/>
<br/>
So my recommendation, Mr. President,<br/>
is that we occupy Medellin.<br/>
<br/>
Flood the streets with officers.<br/>
Conduct searches.<br/>
<br/>
Close down the streets.<br/>
Establish vehicle checkpoints.<br/>
<br/>
Pressure him until he appears,<br/>
Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
And who would conduct such an operation?<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Pinzén, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- He should begin immediately.<br/>
- Of course, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you injured?<br/>
- No, I'm not hurt.<br/>
<br/>
You know I couldn't talk to him.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
- I understand.<br/>
- Why did you go inside?<br/>
<br/>
I sensed something was off.<br/>
<br/>
Ariza said his orders were<br/>
to secure the perimeter, that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, he lied_ I gave the order myself.<br/>
<br/>
Go home and get some rest,<br/>
but come back soon.<br/>
<br/>
You know you're the only person<br/>
I can trust.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.<br/>
Excuse me, Dona Hermilda.<br/>
<br/>
Boss.<br/>
<br/>
- It's good to see you.<br/>
- It's great to have you back home.<br/>
<br/>
Very good to see you.<br/>
<br/>
He's here. It's him.<br/>
<br/>
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.<br/>
- How are you, brother?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Thank God.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, my son!<br/>
- How are you'?<br/>
<br/>
- I'm all right.<br/>
- You're all right?<br/>
<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
- I'm all right.<br/>
<br/>
- You're all right?<br/>
- I'm all right.<br/>
<br/>
- I did everything I could, Dad.<br/>
- I know.<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
<br/>
I am very proud.<br/>
<br/>
I love you very much.<br/>
<br/>
It's Dad.<br/>
<br/>
...you and your family. May he always<br/>
protect you in his holy glory.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
You're great boys.<br/>
<br/>
- Monitor the police frequencies.<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And don't bother me unless it's necessary.<br/>
<br/>
As you wish, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Very good, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Please take the things out of the car<br/>
and organize them over there.<br/>
<br/>
I felt I'd lost you.<br/>
<br/>
You're never going to lose me.<br/>
<br/>
And what now, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
What will we do now?<br/>
<br/>
I did what I had to do, Tata.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be fine, and content,<br/>
<br/>
and happy, and together, and united.<br/>
<br/>
But--<br/>
<br/>
Always.<br/>
<br/>
Always.<br/>
<br/>
- Tell me you'll never leave me.<br/>
- Never.<br/>
<br/>
Promise.<br/>
<br/>
I promise.<br/>
<br/>
I promise, my love.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I understand you're from the DEA,<br/>
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzén first.<br/>
<br/>
Wait one moment.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
We'll let you in once the area is secured,<br/>
understood?<br/>
<br/>
We're going to have to move everything.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you mean by ""everything""?<br/>
- Everything. The labs...<br/>
<br/>
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...<br/>
we're moving everything.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, even the labs?<br/>
<br/>
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, don't you know<br/>
what's going on at La Catedral?<br/>
<br/>
The cops are going through all of the maps<br/>
and documents you idiots left behind.<br/>
<br/>
Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.<br/>
<br/>
Who are you calling a bastard,<br/>
you son of a bitch?<br/>
<br/>
We're... moving... everything.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
We're also going to need more men.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.<br/>
<br/>
- May they rest in peace.<br/>
- Amen.<br/>
<br/>
And one last thing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to need a good driver with a<br/>
clean record to drive me around the city.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.<br/>
<br/>
- Done, boss.<br/>
- Boss, I'm sorry,<br/>
<br/>
but you can't risk yourself like that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.<br/>
<br/>
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar<br/>
doesn't hide like a rat.<br/>
<br/>
Because we...<br/>
<br/>
are the Medellin cartel, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, no!<br/>
<br/>
You believe whatever the f*ck you<br/>
want to believe, you son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
- This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.<br/>
- Relax? What do you want me to do?<br/>
<br/>
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo<br/>
to walk through that door<br/>
<br/>
and k*ll me and my daughter?<br/>
He's going to come and k*ll you, too.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you think about that?<br/>
- Pablo won't be k*ll anyone, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Jaime, what country do you live in?<br/>
<br/>
If he hasn't k*ll anyone yet,<br/>
he's planning on it.<br/>
<br/>
Haven't you noticed, Berna?<br/>
Judy, haven't you noticed?<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria's got this city<br/>
swarming with cops.<br/>
<br/>
There's a cop<br/>
on every f*cking street corner.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo can't move.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have to find and k*ll the bastard<br/>
before the police find him.<br/>
<br/>
Judy, listen.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me! Listen!<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, right now, it's like<br/>
he's like a caged rat. Understand?<br/>
<br/>
Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
Despite everything, you still don't know<br/>
what Pablo`s capable of'?<br/>
<br/>
- He's someone we can't underestimate.<br/>
- You said it, Berna.<br/>
<br/>
They shouldn't underestimate us either.<br/>
<br/>
And Pablo's got very few friends left,<br/>
and you know it.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo will always have friends.<br/>
<br/>
Berna, I want everyone to know<br/>
what happened to Kiko.<br/>
<br/>
It should be clear<br/>
that being loyal to Escobar<br/>
<br/>
will only earn you a b*llet in the head.<br/>
<br/>
They'll know what side<br/>
they should be on, right?<br/>
<br/>
Judy...<br/>
<br/>
what do we do with the labs?<br/>
<br/>
What do you suggest?<br/>
<br/>
I think we shut down the labs,<br/>
at least for a while.<br/>
<br/>
We have to lay low<br/>
until Pablo is k*ll or captured.<br/>
<br/>
That's stupid, Berna.<br/>
Tell me how that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of other people also stopped<br/>
paying Pablo at the same time as us.<br/>
<br/>
Let's join forces with them.<br/>
<br/>
There's the Priscos, for example.<br/>
Last night I met with Ricardo.<br/>
<br/>
I'll talk to him.<br/>
<br/>
Jaime, be very careful with those people.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello?<br/>
- Okay?<br/>
<br/>
- That looks nice.<br/>
- One moment.<br/>
<br/>
Ricardo?<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Of course. There was no decision to make.<br/>
<br/>
You know that you can always count on us.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetie!<br/>
<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
f*g!<br/>
<br/>
What's going on, Limon?<br/>
<br/>
- Son of a bitch.<br/>
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?<br/>
<br/>
Quica, my love, come give me<br/>
the best 20 minutes of my life.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing here? Are you going in?<br/>
<br/>
No, brother.<br/>
I didn't come to see the whores.<br/>
<br/>
- Then what?<br/>
- I came to see you, brother.<br/>
<br/>
And from what I can see,<br/>
you're still driving whores everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Limon,<br/>
don't you want to make good money'?<br/>
<br/>
Doing what?<br/>
<br/>
- The same thing, brother.<br/>
- Driving who?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar, brother.<br/>
<br/>
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.<br/>
- Limon, I'm serious, brother.<br/>
<br/>
The boss asked us to find someone...<br/>
<br/>
someone clean, who the police don't know.<br/>
<br/>
He would go in the trunk.<br/>
<br/>
- Where would I have to take him?<br/>
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think, brother?<br/>
<br/>
There's cops everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't we put a girl in the back<br/>
so no one gets suspicious?<br/>
<br/>
- Which one of the whores do you trust?<br/>
- They're whores, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Then who, brother?<br/>
<br/>
“No!<br/>
Mo?<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
- Why not, Maritza?<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
- What's wrong with it? Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm very busy, Jhon.<br/>
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Ask one of the girls<br/>
you drive around all day.<br/>
<br/>
- I can't.<br/>
- Get out of my way.<br/>
<br/>
Maritza... I need you to do it.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be the easiest money<br/>
you'll make in your life.<br/>
<br/>
You can quit your second job, understand?<br/>
<br/>
You'll be able to take care<br/>
of your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Haven't I always done right by you? I've<br/>
always helped you and your family, right?<br/>
<br/>
So? Right?<br/>
<br/>
You're a son of a bitch, you know?<br/>
<br/>
So what?<br/>
<br/>
- And who's that?<br/>
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.<br/>
<br/>
What's up, Quica?<br/>
This is the girl I told you about.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, skinny!<br/>
<br/>
- All good?<br/>
- All good, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I'll follow you, brother.<br/>
<br/>
- Who's that bitch?<br/>
- Close your f*cking legs, Rosa.<br/>
<br/>
You’ll k*ll all the flowers.<br/>
<br/>
You shit-eating bastard.<br/>
This p*ssy smells great.<br/>
<br/>
Now you're going to the market<br/>
to buy your whores, you bastard?<br/>
<br/>
Don't get Piss!!-<br/>
<br/>
If you're in a better mood<br/>
when I come back this afternoon,<br/>
<br/>
you'll get to f*ck me.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking Quica.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Ready? Close your eyes.<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
It's a little bunny, my love.<br/>
She's very delicate.<br/>
<br/>
Boss?<br/>
<br/>
Look, Don Pablo...<br/>
<br/>
this is the guy<br/>
I've been telling you about, Limon.<br/>
<br/>
He's Guarazapo`s cousin.<br/>
<br/>
Limon! Come here, brother. Come on!<br/>
<br/>
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, boss.<br/>
We've known each other for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, he's never had any run-ins<br/>
with police. He's clean.<br/>
<br/>
And where are you from, son?<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Envigado, sir.<br/>
<br/>
My mother lives in the barrio<br/>
you built for us.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very glad.<br/>
<br/>
- What about the girl?<br/>
- She...<br/>
<br/>
She's a friend, boss.<br/>
<br/>
We went to school together in Envigado.<br/>
I know her very well<br/>
<br/>
and I know where she works,<br/>
so she's someone we can trust, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Limon...<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what it means to work for me?<br/>
<br/>
Ifs an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You've done so much<br/>
for the poor in Medellin...<br/>
<br/>
if I have to lose my life for you...<br/>
<br/>
I will, boss.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Open the trunk.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.<br/>
<br/>
All yours.<br/>
<br/>
Where are we?<br/>
<br/>
- What the f*ck are we doing here, Jhon?<br/>
- Get down and hide.<br/>
<br/>
- Jhon, I don't--<br/>
- Shit, Maritza,<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time to give you<br/>
explanations. Just do it, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello.<br/>
- Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.<br/>
<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
- Very well.<br/>
<br/>
Great, I'm very glad.<br/>
<br/>
- Rojas.<br/>
- Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Sir.<br/>
- How have you been?<br/>
<br/>
Well, sir. How are you?<br/>
I wasn't expecting you.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm well. Very well.<br/>
- Guys, please.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Don Pablo.<br/>
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?<br/>
<br/>
- A coffee?<br/>
- No, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Can I get you anything?<br/>
- Thank you, I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.<br/>
<br/>
- How is Maribel?<br/>
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Good, brother.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on with the deposits?<br/>
<br/>
They're looking a little light.<br/>
<br/>
Well, after everything<br/>
that happened with...<br/>
<br/>
with Mr. Galeano and Mr. Moncada, well...<br/>
people are nervous, you understand?<br/>
<br/>
This woman, Judy Moncada,<br/>
has been talking to people.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone wants to pay.<br/>
<br/>
- So that's it?<br/>
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.<br/>
<br/>
- I told them to tell you--<br/>
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.<br/>
<br/>
We'll fix that problem soon.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime...<br/>
<br/>
I want you to move<br/>
to the offices in Laureles.<br/>
<br/>
Ifs no longer safe here.<br/>
<br/>
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.<br/>
- Good.<br/>

And fill this up, please.<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
- Sir, how are--<br/>
- Is that you?<br/>
<br/>
- How are you, sir?<br/>
- Sweetie! Sweetie!<br/>
<br/>
Sweetie!<br/>
Don Pablo is in front of our house.<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
- Don Pablo!<br/>
- Hello Ma'am. How are you?<br/>
<br/>
- Fine, and you?<br/>
- I'm well.<br/>
<br/>
- It's him, old man.<br/>
- Sir, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
- How is your health?<br/>
- It's good. Very good!<br/>
<br/>
Good. Good. How are all of you?<br/>
Good? Good?<br/>
<br/>
- How are you, Don Pablo?<br/>
- Good.<br/>
<br/>
It's him.<br/>
<br/>
In the flesh?<br/>
<br/>
- Good?<br/>
- Boss, we should get going.<br/>
<br/>
Let them see me. Let them see me.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought I'd meet you in person.<br/>
<br/>
I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?<br/>
<br/>
- Here, boss, behind you.<br/>
- Here. Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.<br/>
- For you.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you, Don Pablo.<br/>
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you, Don Pablo.<br/>
- Take care of yourself.<br/>
<br/>
For you, Ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
For you too, sir.<br/>
<br/>
There's a girl on line three.<br/>
She wants to talk to an American.<br/>
<br/>
- What's wrong, brother?<br/>
- Suck my dick, please.<br/>
<br/>
- DEA Agent Pena.<br/>
- Pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
I know where you can find<br/>
one of Escobar's men.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah? Which one?<br/>
<br/>
There's a reward, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there's a reward.<br/>
<br/>
What's your information, miss?<br/>
Who are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
La Quica.<br/>
<br/>
La Quica?<br/>
<br/>
You know La Quica?<br/>
<br/>
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.<br/>
<br/>
He left with a man in a taxi<br/>
and said he would return later.<br/>
<br/>
Do you work there?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
How long ago was this?<br/>
<br/>
A couple of hours ago.<br/>
<br/>
All right, we'll look into it.<br/>
<br/>
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
We're not asking for a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Did you close the lab?<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
No, Berna, and I won't<br/>
because it's not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
- Listen to me, Jaime--<br/>
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.<br/>
<br/>
I already spoke with<br/>
Ricardo Prisco, all right?<br/>
<br/>
He's with us. He supports us.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is firm. Everything is good.<br/>
What more could we want?<br/>
<br/>
I told you to be careful<br/>
with those people, Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
Pay attention to me.<br/>
<br/>
First, these guys have been with us<br/>
since Pablo k*ll Kiko, right?<br/>
<br/>
Second, Ricardo knows<br/>
that being loyal to Pablo<br/>
<br/>
means a b*llet in the head, brother.<br/>
<br/>
And third, and to ease your mind,<br/>
they're sending us men, for security--<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
So you gave these people<br/>
the address to the lab?<br/>
<br/>
Don't be an idiot.<br/>
How else would they get here?<br/>
<br/>
Jaime, listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
Get out of there now.<br/>
Get moving and come here right now!<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me, Berna!<br/>
Stop with the paranoia, brother!<br/>
<br/>
Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!<br/>
<br/>
- Come here now!<br/>
- Come play, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Jaime! Jaime!<br/>
<br/>
Get out now!<br/>
<br/>
What's going on, Ricardo?<br/>
<br/>
You're f*cking up, man.<br/>
<br/>
Ricardo, put the g*n down, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Ricardo, put it down.<br/>
Pablo is weak right now, brother.<br/>
<br/>
You know this.<br/>
<br/>
The city's filled with cops.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo can't move, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Ricardo, put the g*n down.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
- Berna, how have you been?<br/>
- Who's this?<br/>
<br/>
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine<br/>
you want to talk to Jaime, right?<br/>
<br/>
Berna, help me, man.<br/>
<br/>
Berna, talk to Pablo.<br/>
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, no! Wait!<br/>
<br/>
And now, you fat son of a bitch...<br/>
<br/>
we're coming after you<br/>
and that bitch you protect.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, you've just made<br/>
the biggest mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the others...<br/>
<br/>
Who is it?<br/>
<br/>
...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,<br/>
<br/>
you son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
That son of a bitch!<br/>
His entire family, do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
I want everyone<br/>
in his f*cking family d*ad!<br/>
<br/>
That fat f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Judy...<br/>
<br/>
I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very<br/>
sorry about all of these deaths.<br/>
<br/>
We have to accept that we lost this time.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what?<br/>
I'll be with you until the end.<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to go ahead on<br/>
against Pablo, just say so.<br/>
<br/>
We'll find strong allies. And people.<br/>
We'll need a lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
You're right.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have to see things<br/>
for what they are.<br/>
<br/>
The truth of the matter, just as it is.<br/>
<br/>
And this is the truth, Berna:<br/>
<br/>
I know of someone who's very powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who wants to k*ll Pablo<br/>
as much as I do.<br/>
<br/>
- You sure it's not a trap?<br/>
- I'm not sure of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
You did very well, sister.<br/>
<br/>
Look... you don't just get two,<br/>
you get three.<br/>
<br/>
You have a special talent, and that's why<br/>
you get three instead of two green ones.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?<br/>
I know of a nice calm place.<br/>
<br/>
We could have fun.<br/>
<br/>
I can't.<br/>
I have to take care of my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limon.<br/>
- All right, brother.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to f*ck one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetie...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Maritza.<br/>
<br/>
Bastard.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!<br/>
<br/>
Right here, to the right.<br/>
It's the next right.<br/>
<br/>
Know the area well, don't you, Pena?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.<br/>
<br/>
Calm down! Calm down!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's go.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Wait for me here.<br/>
<br/>
- Trujillo!<br/>
- Go around! Go around!<br/>
<br/>
Move! Move! Move!<br/>
<br/>
Move! Move! Move!<br/>
<br/>
Brother!<br/>
<br/>
God damn it. What?<br/>
<br/>
- Quica! Quica!<br/>
- What's the problem, brother?<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!<br/>
<br/>
Brother! Hurry, Quica!<br/>
<br/>
They're cops, brother! Run!<br/>
<br/>
Stop looking.<br/>
This is the best place to eat.<br/>
<br/>
The situation is that...<br/>
<br/>
your escape has left us without...<br/>
We don't have a lot of options.<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn't escaped,<br/>
they would have k*ll me, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
Or I'd rot in an American jail.<br/>
<br/>
- You will tell Gaviria--<br/>
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it's a good time.<br/>
<br/>
You will tell Gaviria...<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to go back to La Catedral<br/>
to finish my sentence.<br/>
<br/>
As you wish.<br/>
<br/>
- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogoté.<br/>
- No, no, no, brother.<br/>
<br/>
We can't... leave for tomorrow<br/>
what we can do today.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President,<br/>
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.<br/>
<br/>
- I don't have anything to say to him.<br/>
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important<br/>
message from Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
He says he's willing to negotiate the<br/>
conditions for his return to La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
Turn on the television.<br/>
<br/>
- What did he say?<br/>
- He told us to turn on the television.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening, compatriots.<br/>
<br/>
In the last year and a half, we've<br/>
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...<br/>
<br/>
for over a decade.<br/>
<br/>
Now we can go to work,<br/>
<br/>
drop our children off at school,<br/>
and enjoy life's small pleasures...<br/>
<br/>
without the thr*at of v*olence<br/>
looming around every corner.<br/>
<br/>
This peace is now thr*at<br/>
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar has been named the bloodiest<br/>
narcoterrorist of all time.<br/>
<br/>
This history... changes today.<br/>
<br/>
But I need your help.<br/>
<br/>
We must come together as a people,<br/>
as a country,<br/>
<br/>
so his reign of term: comes to an end<br/>
here and now.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I'm before you now...<br/>
<br/>
offering a reward of 1.4 million dollars<br/>
<br/>
for whoever gives information<br/>
leading to his capture.<br/>
<br/>
It is my hope that through this reward...<br/>
<br/>
the day will finally come when our country<br/>
is free of Pablo's grip...<br/>
<br/>
and will cease to be held hostage<br/>
by terror, intimidation...<br/>
<br/>
and m*rder.<br/>
<br/>
I want to make it very clear...<br/>
<br/>
that under no circumstances...<br/>
<br/>
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.</div>]","Hey, Jimenez...

Do you think
the Special Forces guys k*ll him'?

If he can even be k*ll, that is.

What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

I don't know.

I heard they sh*t him 20 times.

They pumped him full of lead.

Then they b*rned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellin.

They say that he rose from the ashes,

and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had sh*t him,

and he k*ll them as they slept.

Bullshit.

Quiet! Someone's coming.

We're soldiers from the National Army!

Stop and identify yourselves!

We're well armed!

Mr. Escobar.

I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

We have to take you into custody.

Son, I'm sorry to say...

unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

Excuse me.

You don't speak a word of this to anyone,
understood?

This...

is an enormous embarrassment
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

So...

-how will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

and we can't allow him and his sicarios
to move freely.

So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellin.

Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

Pressure him until he appears,
Mr. President.

And who would conduct such an operation?

Colonel Pinzén, sir.

- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, Mr. President.

- Are you injured?
- No, I'm not hurt.

You know I couldn't talk to him.

I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

I sensed something was off.

Ariza said his orders were
to secure the perimeter, that's all.

Wait, he lied_ I gave the order myself.

Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.

You know you're the only person
I can trust.

Yes, sir.

It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Dona Hermilda.

Boss.

- It's good to see you.
- It's great to have you back home.

Very good to see you.

He's here. It's him.

- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.
- How are you, brother?

Pablo!

Thank God.

- Oh, my son!
- How are you'?

- I'm all right.
- You're all right?

- How are you?
- I'm all right.

- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

I know.

I am very proud.

I love you very much.

It's Dad.

...you and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

Thank you very much.

You're great boys.

- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

And don't bother me unless it's necessary.

As you wish, boss.

Very good.

Very good, gentlemen.

Very good.

Please take the things out of the car
and organize them over there.

I felt I'd lost you.

You're never going to lose me.

And what now, Pablo?

What will we do now?

I did what I had to do, Tata.

I'll take care of it.

We'll be fine, and content,

and happy, and together, and united.

But--

Always.

Always.

- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

Promise.

I promise.

I promise, my love.

Yes, I understand you're from the DEA,
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzén first.

Wait one moment.

Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

We'll let you in once the area is secured,
understood?

We're going to have to move everything.

- What do you mean by ""everything""?
- Everything. The labs...

the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

Boss, even the labs?

They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.

Who are you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch?

We're... moving... everything.

Right?
- Yes, sir.

Yes, Don Pablo.

We're also going to need more men.

Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

And one last thing.

I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

- Done, boss.
- Boss, I'm sorry,

but you can't risk yourself like that.

Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

Because we...

are the Medellin cartel, f*ck!

Pablo, no!

You believe whatever the f*ck you
want to believe, you son of a bitch!

- This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.
- Relax? What do you want me to do?

Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

and k*ll me and my daughter?
He's going to come and k*ll you, too.

- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be k*ll anyone, all right?

Jaime, what country do you live in?

If he hasn't k*ll anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

There's a cop
on every f*cking street corner.

Pablo can't move.

Then we have to find and k*ll the bastard
before the police find him.

Judy, listen.

Listen to me! Listen!

Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

Jaime.

Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo`s capable of'?

- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

They shouldn't underestimate us either.

And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

Pablo will always have friends.

Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

will only earn you a b*llet in the head.

They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

Judy...

what do we do with the labs?

What do you suggest?

I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

We have to lay low
until Pablo is k*ll or captured.

That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense.

A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

Let's join forces with them.

There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

I'll talk to him.

Jaime, be very careful with those people.

- Hello?
- Okay?

- That looks nice.
- One moment.

Ricardo?

Don Pablo.

Of course. There was no decision to make.

You know that you can always count on us.

Sweetie!

Hey!

f*g!

What's going on, Limon?

- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

What are you doing here? Are you going in?

No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

Listen, Limon,
don't you want to make good money'?

Doing what?

- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

Pablo Escobar, brother.

- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limon, I'm serious, brother.

The boss asked us to find someone...

someone clean, who the police don't know.

He would go in the trunk.

- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

What do you think, brother?

There's cops everywhere.

Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

Then who, brother?

“No!
Mo?

- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

- No.
- What's wrong with it? Nothing.

- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

Yes?

Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

Maritza... I need you to do it.

It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

You can quit your second job, understand?

You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

Haven't I always done right by you? I've
always helped you and your family, right?

So? Right?

You're a son of a bitch, you know?

So what?

- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

Let's go.

Take care, skinny!

- All good?
- All good, brother.

I'll follow you, brother.

- Who's that bitch?
- Close your f*cking legs, Rosa.

You’ll k*ll all the flowers.

You shit-eating bastard.
This p*ssy smells great.

Now you're going to the market
to buy your whores, you bastard?

Don't get Piss!!-

If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

you'll get to f*ck me.

f*cking Quica.

Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

Ready? Close your eyes.

That's right.

It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

Boss?

Look, Don Pablo...

this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limon.

He's Guarazapo`s cousin.

Limon! Come here, brother. Come on!

It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

Besides, he's never had any run-ins
with police. He's clean.

And where are you from, son?

I was born in Envigado, sir.

My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

I'm very glad.

- What about the girl?
- She...

She's a friend, boss.

We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her very well

and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

Listen, Limon...

Do you know what it means to work for me?

Ifs an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.

You've done so much
for the poor in Medellin...

if I have to lose my life for you...

I will, boss.

All right.

Open the trunk.

Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

All yours.

Where are we?

- What the f*ck are we doing here, Jhon?
- Get down and hide.

- Jhon, I don't--
- Shit, Maritza,

I don't have time to give you
explanations. Just do it, all right?

Don Pablo.

- Hello.
- Welcome.

Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.

- How are you?
- Very well.

Great, I'm very glad.

- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

- Sir.
- How have you been?

Well, sir. How are you?
I wasn't expecting you.

- I'm well. Very well.
- Guys, please.

Yes, sir.

- Don Pablo.
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?

- A coffee?
- No, thank you.

- Can I get you anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

- How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

Good, brother.

What's going on with the deposits?

They're looking a little light.

Well, after everything
that happened with...

with Mr. Galeano and Mr. Moncada, well...
people are nervous, you understand?

This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been talking to people.

Not everyone wants to pay.

- So that's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

- I told them to tell you--
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

We'll fix that problem soon.

Yes, sir.

In the meantime...

I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

Ifs no longer safe here.

- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

And fill this up, please.

Don Pablo!

- Sir, how are--
- Is that you?

- How are you, sir?
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

Don Pablo?

- Don Pablo!
- Hello Ma'am. How are you?

- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

It's him.

In the flesh?

- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

Let them see me. Let them see me.

I never thought I'd meet you in person.

I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?

- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

For you, Ma'am.

For you too, sir.

There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

- What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

- DEA Agent Pena.
- Pay attention.

I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

Oh, yeah? Which one?

There's a reward, right?

Yes, there's a reward.

What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

La Quica.

La Quica?

You know La Quica?

He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

Do you work there?

Yes.

How long ago was this?

A couple of hours ago.

All right, we'll look into it.

It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

We're not asking for a lot.

Did you close the lab?

Jesus Christ.

No, Berna, and I won't
because it's not necessary.

- Listen to me, Jaime--
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.

I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

He's with us. He supports us.

Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

Pay attention to me.

First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo k*ll Kiko, right?

Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

means a b*llet in the head, brother.

And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security--

What?

So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?

Jaime, listen to me.

Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia, brother!

Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!

- Come here now!
- Come play, f*ck!

Jaime! Jaime!

Get out now!

What's going on, Ricardo?

You're f*cking up, man.

Ricardo, put the g*n down, brother.

Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

You know this.

The city's filled with cops.

Pablo can't move, brother.

Ricardo, put the g*n down.

Hello, Jaime.

Jaime.

- Berna, how have you been?
- Who's this?

This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

Berna, help me, man.

Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

Pablo, no! Wait!

And now, you fat son of a bitch...

we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

Tell the others...

Who is it?

...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

you son of a bitch.

That son of a bitch!
His entire family, do you understand?

I want everyone
in his f*cking family d*ad!

That fat f*ck!

Son of a bitch!

Listen, Judy...

I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very
sorry about all of these deaths.

We have to accept that we lost this time.

But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

And if you want to go ahead on
against Pablo, just say so.

We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

Yes.

You're right.

Yes.

I think we have to see things
for what they are.

The truth of the matter, just as it is.

And this is the truth, Berna:

I know of someone who's very powerful.

Someone who wants to k*ll Pablo
as much as I do.

- You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

Hello, Fernando.

You did very well, sister.

Look... you don't just get two,
you get three.

You have a special talent, and that's why
you get three instead of two green ones.

What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

We could have fun.

I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limon.
- All right, brother.

I'm going to f*ck one of them.

Sweetie...

Thank you, Maritza.

Bastard.

Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

Right here, to the right.
It's the next right.

Know the area well, don't you, Pena?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

Calm down! Calm down!

Okay, let's go.

All right. Wait for me here.

- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

Move! Move! Move!

Move! Move! Move!

Brother!

God damn it. What?

- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem, brother?

Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

Brother! Hurry, Quica!

They're cops, brother! Run!

Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

The situation is that...

your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

If I hadn't escaped,
they would have k*ll me, Fernando.

Or I'd rot in an American jail.

- You will tell Gaviria--
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

I don't think it's a good time.

You will tell Gaviria...

I am willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

As you wish.

- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogoté.
- No, no, no, brother.

We can't... leave for tomorrow
what we can do today.

Right?

Mr. President,
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.

- I don't have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.

Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important
message from Mr. Escobar.

He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

Turn on the television.

- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

Good evening, compatriots.

In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...

for over a decade.

Now we can go to work,

drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...

without the thr*at of v*olence
looming around every corner.

This peace is now thr*at
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.

Escobar has been named the bloodiest
narcoterrorist of all time.

This history... changes today.

But I need your help.

We must come together as a people,
as a country,

so his reign of term: comes to an end
here and now.

This is why I'm before you now...

offering a reward of 1.4 million dollars

for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.

It is my hope that through this reward...

the day will finally come when our country
is free of Pablo's grip...

and will cease to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...

and m*rder.

I want to make it very clear...

that under no circumstances...

will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar."
01x10 - Despegue,"[<div class=""content"">When the public found out<br/>
about the excessive lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
of the prisoners at La Catedral,<br/>
<br/>
the police began an investigation<br/>
into the supposed capital crimes<br/>
<br/>
being committed by Pablo Escobar<br/>
within the prison walls.<br/>
<br/>
The central part of this investigation<br/>
involves the disappearance<br/>
<br/>
of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.<br/>
<br/>
- Agent Peña?<br/>
- What's this?<br/>
<br/>
It's from upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I get a card.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, CIA.<br/>
<br/>
""Congratulations,<br/>
Central Intelligence Agency.""<br/>
<br/>
This is, uh... this is blowing up<br/>
a little bit more than we expected, no?<br/>
<br/>
Well, hopefully,<br/>
the son of a bitch rots in jail.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<br/>
We gotta transfer him first.<br/>
<br/>
- I forbade you to leak this.<br/>
- How do you know it was us?<br/>
<br/>
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.<br/>
- 'Course it was you.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever did this, it doesn't really<br/>
matter now. What's done is done.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, like you said, this is<br/>
a Colombian matter. What do we care?<br/>
<br/>
I'm filing a report with the<br/>
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.<br/>
<br/>
- Ambassador...<br/>
- Good, report to Washington.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause if something isn't done,<br/>
every American down here<br/>
<br/>
associated with the government<br/>
is gonna look like a fool, including you.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't finished. Until further notice,<br/>
you're both suspended.<br/>
<br/>
Go home.<br/>
<br/>
m*rder AT LA CATEDRAL?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President,<br/>
I just spoke with the attorney general.<br/>
<br/>
Moncada's wife reported<br/>
his disappearance from La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
It's clear that Escobar<br/>
k*ll those men in that prison.<br/>
<br/>
- I don't think he'd take it that far.<br/>
- Escobar is capable of anything.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what?<br/>
This could be a good opportunity for us.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me, Eduardo...<br/>
<br/>
but I'm having a hard time<br/>
finding the silver lining in all this.<br/>
<br/>
This is our opportunity<br/>
to end Pablo's vacation.<br/>
<br/>
- Boss.<br/>
- Good morning, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh!<br/>
<br/>
Good morning, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Bad news.<br/>
<br/>
Have the bodies disappeared?<br/>
<br/>
Our agreement with him states<br/>
he can't be moved to another prison.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, but k*ll people in prison<br/>
is a direct violation of our agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes,<br/>
but we have to tread carefully.<br/>
<br/>
If he feels we're violating his terms,<br/>
<br/>
he'll start putting b*mb<br/>
on street corners again.<br/>
<br/>
Let's tell him we've uncovered thr*at<br/>
against him from his biggest enemies.<br/>
<br/>
That would give us the opportunity<br/>
to bring him to Bogotá<br/>
<br/>
while we improve security<br/>
at La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth brigade,<br/>
commanded by General Ariza,<br/>
<br/>
would be the best choice<br/>
to carry out this operation.<br/>
<br/>
- Ariza?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Is he from Medellín?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Hm.<br/>
<br/>
Can we trust him?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Success.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, it cost me a suspension,<br/>
but who cares?<br/>
<br/>
I just call it a week's paternity leave.<br/>
<br/>
I was ready to crack a beer<br/>
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.<br/>
<br/>
See, because of me and Peña,<br/>
<br/>
the Colombian government<br/>
was sending in the army.<br/>
<br/>
Not the cops,<br/>
but the f*cking army.<br/>
<br/>
There was no way that Escobar<br/>
was getting out of this one.<br/>
<br/>
But, then again, in Colombia...<br/>
<br/>
nothing goes down<br/>
the way you think it will.<br/>
<br/>
I'm calling him.<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo, here...<br/>
Tata's on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking<br/>
there's nothing in the world I'd love more<br/>
<br/>
than to hear my wife's lovely voice.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, what's happening?<br/>
<br/>
Why would something<br/>
be happening here?<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Soldiers?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of them.<br/>
Headed to the prison right now.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what's happening.<br/>
<br/>
No, my love, it's nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is cool.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call back soon, all right?<br/>
<br/>
I love you, baby.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my love.<br/>
<br/>
Get out the w*apon.<br/>
<br/>
As you wish, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Listen up, company!<br/>
<br/>
You will be under the command<br/>
of Lieutenant Dominguez.<br/>
<br/>
Let's secure the perimeter.<br/>
<br/>
Tell your men<br/>
they have orders to sh**t anyone<br/>
<br/>
- trying to leave the prison, understood?<br/>
- As you wish, General.<br/>
<br/>
Dismissed.<br/>
<br/>
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?<br/>
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.<br/>
<br/>
- No, dear, you can't go there now.<br/>
- I said I want to go!<br/>
<br/>
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.<br/>
- He needs you to stay here<br/>
<br/>
to look after your sister.<br/>
Isn't that what he always says?<br/>
<br/>
- But the soldiers are going to k*ll him.<br/>
- Don't ever say that in this house!<br/>
<br/>
- They're going to k*ll him!<br/>
- Quiet!<br/>
<br/>
The car was<br/>
outside the garage, still idling,<br/>
<br/>
the keys still in the ignition.<br/>
<br/>
- I've called his phone 20 times.<br/>
- Did you call embassy security?<br/>
<br/>
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.<br/>
- Good. Don't.<br/>
<br/>
What? Why not?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing. I just... I don't wanna<br/>
ring any alarms before I check things out.<br/>
<br/>
- What are you guys up to?<br/>
- Connie...<br/>
<br/>
Just try to relax, OK?<br/>
I'm sure everything's fine.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna take care of this.<br/>
<br/>
I'll find out where he is, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'll make you a drink.<br/>
<br/>
Boss...<br/>
<br/>
they're gonna<br/>
try to take you out of here<br/>
<br/>
and look for evidence<br/>
on Moncada and Galeano.<br/>
<br/>
If I leave this place,<br/>
someone will k*ll me.<br/>
<br/>
Or the Americans will use their power to<br/>
restore extradition and send me to the US.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck,<br/>
let's give those bastards lead.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you crazy?<br/>
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
For every one of our men,<br/>
they have 20!<br/>
<br/>
- Let's do it now.<br/>
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!<br/>
<br/>
Stop bickering in front of the boss.<br/>
<br/>
We have the escape routes.<br/>
<br/>
We could get into the hills<br/>
before they even know we're gone.<br/>
<br/>
There is a time to fight...<br/>
<br/>
and there is a time to be clever.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- What's your plan?<br/>
- Let's talk to Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
Be smart.<br/>
<br/>
Try to settle this matter peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
If that fails?<br/>
<br/>
What the hell are you doing back here?<br/>
<br/>
- I forgot my socks.<br/>
- I want you out in five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch. These Colombians<br/>
are knee-deep in a shit storm.<br/>
<br/>
We gotta talk.<br/>
<br/>
Back here.<br/>
<br/>
What? You get a hooker pregnant?<br/>
<br/>
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.<br/>
<br/>
I checked all area hospitals,<br/>
police stations.<br/>
<br/>
We were pursuing leads<br/>
on the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
It could be related to that,<br/>
or it could be Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Did you report it<br/>
to the Regional Security Office?<br/>
<br/>
If I tell the ROS,<br/>
it becomes a five-alarm f*re,<br/>
<br/>
and whoever has him might panic.<br/>
<br/>
If it is Escobar,<br/>
he's d*ad already.<br/>
<br/>
Well, can you check your sources?<br/>
See what comes up?<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
Let me see what I can do.<br/>
<br/>
General Ariza<br/>
has orders to secure Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to go there<br/>
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you mean, ""legalize"" it?<br/>
- Formalize it.<br/>
<br/>
You'll reiterate<br/>
that this is a temporary relocation<br/>
<br/>
while we renovate La Catedral<br/>
to make it safer for him.<br/>
<br/>
We both know that's not true.<br/>
<br/>
But it's what you'll tell Escobar<br/>
until he's safely inside a military brig.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
I've got a bad feeling about this.<br/>
<br/>
Eduardo, I trust you...<br/>
<br/>
and this is too important to leave<br/>
to someone I don't trust completely.<br/>
<br/>
I'm at your service,<br/>
Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
You know that very well.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing will make me happier than to see<br/>
that assh*le get the justice he deserves.<br/>
<br/>
Checked my sources with the Colombian<br/>
military. Nobody knows jack shit.<br/>
<br/>
So there's no indication Escobar had<br/>
anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?<br/>
<br/>
It's time to sound the alarm.<br/>
<br/>
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?<br/>
<br/>
We call out the troops,<br/>
he ends up d*ad like Diana Turbay.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet<br/>
<br/>
until further notice, understand?<br/>
<br/>
All right. What else do you have?<br/>
<br/>
- I know that.<br/>
- Velasco.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call you back.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, boss?<br/>
<br/>
What's happening outside?<br/>
<br/>
We don't know.<br/>
<br/>
I f*cked up.<br/>
<br/>
What's that, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Gather the boys.<br/>
<br/>
And tell the prison guards they're<br/>
to f*re on anyone who tries to come in.<br/>
<br/>
Boss, do you think the prison guards<br/>
will follow your orders?<br/>
<br/>
They'd better. I hired them.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. Boss, the people<br/>
from Medellín just informed me<br/>
<br/>
that some guy named<br/>
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening.<br/>
Where is General Ariza?<br/>
<br/>
General!<br/>
<br/>
Let him through.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening, General.<br/>
<br/>
- Mr. Vice Minister.<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
<br/>
Pleasure to see you.<br/>
Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
- Where's Escobar?<br/>
- Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Inside the prison, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean,<br/>
he's in the prison?<br/>
<br/>
I thought you were taking him into custody<br/>
when you arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, sir,<br/>
but those were not my orders.<br/>
<br/>
Then what were your orders?<br/>
<br/>
My orders were to secure the perimeter,<br/>
not let anyone in or out,<br/>
<br/>
and wait for you.<br/>
<br/>
That's not what the president believes.<br/>
<br/>
He's not going to be happy<br/>
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry,<br/>
but those were my orders.<br/>
<br/>
I turned myself in to that punk...<br/>
the vice minister of justice.<br/>
<br/>
But since there is<br/>
no justice in this country,<br/>
<br/>
he is the vice minister of nothing.<br/>
<br/>
This is good.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.<br/>
<br/>
This is very good.<br/>
<br/>
General, I don't believe<br/>
you understand your orders clearly.<br/>
<br/>
- But I do.<br/>
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try<br/>
to make a miracle happen.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going in there to convince Escobar<br/>
this is a temporary transfer of location.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm also going to say<br/>
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.<br/>
<br/>
I can't allow you<br/>
to put yourself in danger.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough<br/>
to k*ll the vice minister of justice<br/>
<br/>
right in front of the fourth brigade?<br/>
For God's sake.<br/>
<br/>
At least let me make a call<br/>
so they don't sh**t you when you walk in!<br/>
<br/>
Make it fast. Open the door.<br/>
You two are coming with me.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't you hear me?<br/>
Open the door! General!<br/>
<br/>
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!<br/>
<br/>
Open it.<br/>
<br/>
Vice Minister, good evening.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.<br/>
<br/>
Wait here.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening, Vice Minister.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a while.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
My orders are to escort you<br/>
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
The government has decided to make<br/>
some improvements here at La Catedral<br/>
<br/>
for your safety<br/>
and everyone else's here.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
I would think Gaviria<br/>
could come up with a more believable lie.<br/>
<br/>
I know why you're here.<br/>
Because of Moncada and Galeano.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn't k*ll those men.<br/>
That story is a lie.<br/>
<br/>
And why should the government care<br/>
about some dispute between gangsters?<br/>
<br/>
We don't care about that.<br/>
You're mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.<br/>
Gaviria is betraying me.<br/>
<br/>
If your safety is a concern,<br/>
I will gladly escort you out myself.<br/>
<br/>
We have an agreement,<br/>
and you're breaking it.<br/>
<br/>
What guarantee do I have<br/>
that the Americans won't kidnap me<br/>
<br/>
and take me to the US?<br/>
<br/>
Bush would be very happy<br/>
to stick me in a gringo jail,<br/>
<br/>
like he did to Lehder,<br/>
like he did to Noriega, right?<br/>
<br/>
That's not gonna happen,<br/>
you have my word.<br/>
<br/>
- Your word.<br/>
- Mm.<br/>
<br/>
As vice minister of justice?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I give you my word<br/>
as vice minister of justice.<br/>
<br/>
Haven't you noticed that the army<br/>
has completely surrounded this jail?<br/>
<br/>
We can end this peacefully...<br/>
<br/>
if you just cooperate<br/>
and walk out with me.<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo,<br/>
these bastards will k*ll you!<br/>
<br/>
I respectfully decline your offer,<br/>
Vice Minister.<br/>
<br/>
The press is saying I k*ll those men,<br/>
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.<br/>
<br/>
If Gaviria wants me out of here...<br/>
<br/>
he can come here...<br/>
and do it himself.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile...<br/>
<br/>
I'll view any incursion<br/>
as a declaration of w*r.<br/>
<br/>
I'll inform the president<br/>
of your position.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Vice Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Why walk all that way<br/>
when I have a telephone in my office?<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather call the president<br/>
from outside the prison, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Let me out!<br/>
<br/>
Surely your mother taught you<br/>
never to turn down a polite invitation.<br/>
<br/>
My mother taught me<br/>
an invitation is optional.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you'll forgive me<br/>
for making this invitation mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
It's not every day we're honored with the<br/>
presence of a vice minister of justice.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Vice Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Calm down, let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Where have you been?<br/>
You don't even answer your phone?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I've, uh...<br/>
I've been working on it.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck does that mean?<br/>
Doing what?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to hold it together.<br/>
<br/>
God, I just wanna go home.<br/>
<br/>
I want my husband back.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
You're just not sure he's d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
What's taking this guy so long?<br/>
<br/>
General, with all due respect,<br/>
<br/>
I don't think we should've<br/>
let him go inside.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough<br/>
to f*ck with the vice minister.<br/>
<br/>
Can I get you something to drink?<br/>
<br/>
I don't need anything.<br/>
<br/>
Look, don't be so nervous.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you have the president<br/>
on the phone, you will make it clear<br/>
<br/>
that if he doesn't remove the troops<br/>
surrounding the prison immediately,<br/>
<br/>
there will be grave consequences.<br/>
<br/>
But if he withdraws the troops,<br/>
<br/>
we'll stay here quietly<br/>
and complete our sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Good evening,<br/>
President Gaviria's office.<br/>
<br/>
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.<br/>
I need to talk to the president.<br/>
<br/>
One minute, please.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President,<br/>
excuse the interruption.<br/>
<br/>
There is a call from<br/>
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you, María.<br/>
- Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
How long will I be here<br/>
as a hostage?<br/>
<br/>
You are not my hostage.<br/>
You are my guest.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar has Sandoval<br/>
inside the prison.<br/>
<br/>
Hang up right now,<br/>
Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
- Hang up, please.<br/>
- I need to know if he's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President,<br/>
hang up the phone.<br/>
<br/>
If Escobar knows you're on the line,<br/>
he might force you to strike a bargain.<br/>
<br/>
Or worse, if you lie to him,<br/>
he might k*ll Eduardo.<br/>
<br/>
Hang up the phone. Sir!<br/>
<br/>
Leave us alone.<br/>
<br/>
- They hung up.<br/>
- Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up!<br/>
<br/>
So, then...<br/>
<br/>
the president is too busy<br/>
to speak with me.<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand<br/>
how he ended up in that jail.<br/>
<br/>
Me, either.<br/>
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.<br/>
<br/>
What did he think, that he could convince<br/>
Escobar he was there to help him?<br/>
<br/>
We agreed that Ariza<br/>
would have Escobar in custody.<br/>
<br/>
Ariza must've had his reasons<br/>
for holding off.<br/>
<br/>
- Right.<br/>
- This is a very delicate situation.<br/>
<br/>
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.<br/>
<br/>
Please, I suggest we call DAS<br/>
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have your permission?<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
María Clara, connect me<br/>
with DAS, immediately.<br/>
<br/>
- No. No.<br/>
- Cancel the call.<br/>
<br/>
- This time, we will not negotiate.<br/>
- I don't understand, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
If Sandoval dies...<br/>
<br/>
I will have it on my conscience<br/>
for the rest of my life.<br/>
<br/>
But my country comes first,<br/>
and I will not empower Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Send in the Special Forces...<br/>
and finish this, once and for all.<br/>
<br/>
I just realized something.<br/>
<br/>
The president didn't just betray me...<br/>
<br/>
he also betrayed you.<br/>
<br/>
He knew if you came here...<br/>
Look at me.<br/>
<br/>
...there would be three options.<br/>
<br/>
One: I leave with you, peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
Two: I take you hostage.<br/>
<br/>
Three: I sh**t you,<br/>
<br/>
and then, he really would<br/>
have a good excuse to k*ll me.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, he wins.<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the president<br/>
is betraying us both.<br/>
<br/>
You could be right.<br/>
<br/>
But you know something?<br/>
<br/>
I'll sacrifice my life<br/>
to make sure you're d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
You think you're better than me,<br/>
but you're wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I come from nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I fought hard<br/>
to become what I am.<br/>
<br/>
If the government<br/>
hadn't come after me...<br/>
<br/>
I would be where you are now...<br/>
the vice minister of justice.<br/>
<br/>
You and I are nothing alike.<br/>
<br/>
You are a criminal.<br/>
<br/>
And criminals can't run forever.<br/>
<br/>
Sir.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend Gaviria has ordered<br/>
Special Forces to raid the prison<br/>
<br/>
while you're still inside.<br/>
<br/>
I would have done the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Don't k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
If he dies... it will be<br/>
at the hands of his own government.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Vice Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Now what?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Ambassador.<br/>
We have a situation.<br/>
<br/>
Damn right we do.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, partner.<br/>
<br/>
Remember how I told you<br/>
that no one in their right mind<br/>
<br/>
would ever k*ll a DEA agent?<br/>
<br/>
Well, to be honest,<br/>
after they snatched me,<br/>
<br/>
I'd forgotten that, myself.<br/>
<br/>
But then, I calmed down and realized<br/>
that if they wanted to k*ll me,<br/>
<br/>
they would've blown my brains out<br/>
right in front of my house.<br/>
<br/>
This... was something different.<br/>
<br/>
I figured this was Escobar<br/>
knowing that they were coming to get him,<br/>
<br/>
and grabbing<br/>
a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.<br/>
<br/>
Sit.<br/>
<br/>
Man, you f*cked up. You think<br/>
that they're gonna make a trade for me?<br/>
<br/>
No. No!<br/>
<br/>
They're gonna storm that bullshit f*ck'<br/>
prison and blow his f*ck' head off!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry<br/>
you were taken against your will,<br/>
<br/>
but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,<br/>
given your last meeting with Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see<br/>
your Cali cartel is doing so well,<br/>
<br/>
but you've made a huge mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking<br/>
the liberty of making you a cocktail.<br/>
<br/>
I just learned how to do a really<br/>
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.<br/>
<br/>
That's wonderful,<br/>
but I don't want your f*ck' daiquiri.<br/>
<br/>
You're free to leave anytime.<br/>
We are a long way from Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Fine. I'm leaving.<br/>
I'll show myself out.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you might<br/>
like to see some pictures I have.<br/>
<br/>
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you<br/>
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo<br/>
<br/>
to ID a location<br/>
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Two hours later, they were d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Along with an innocent woman.<br/>
<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
Poison will be at La Dispensaria<br/>
<br/>
at around midnight with his crew.<br/>
<br/>
Who's your contact at the embassy?<br/>
<br/>
Did you know she had two kids?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think our newspapers<br/>
will think of that?<br/>
<br/>
Our government doesn't take too kindly<br/>
to American-backed death squads.<br/>
<br/>
I could blackmail you<br/>
with these pictures.<br/>
<br/>
You'd lose your career at the DEA,<br/>
<br/>
go to jail...<br/>
maybe here in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
But don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
I won't ask you or Javier Peña<br/>
<br/>
to cross any line<br/>
you haven't already crossed.<br/>
<br/>
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel<br/>
would be a good match.<br/>
<br/>
There are many,<br/>
in every segment of Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
who have been persecuted<br/>
by Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
The families of Moncada and Galeano,<br/>
<br/>
the families of judges and police...<br/>
<br/>
people with resources<br/>
who need to be unified.<br/>
<br/>
They want vengeance.<br/>
<br/>
- And you'll help them get it?<br/>
- With your help.<br/>
<br/>
I can't make any commitments right now.<br/>
<br/>
But I can tell you this:<br/>
<br/>
When Pablo goes down,<br/>
and he will go down...<br/>
<br/>
you'll hear a knock at your door,<br/>
<br/>
and it'll be me.<br/>
<br/>
You haven't tried my daiquiri.<br/>
<br/>
That Herrera's a pretty good host.<br/>
<br/>
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you<br/>
door-to-door service right to the embassy.<br/>
<br/>
- What did Herrera say?<br/>
- What'd he say?<br/>
<br/>
What'd he say?<br/>
<br/>
You f*ck' gave him that information.<br/>
<br/>
He's got pictures on me,<br/>
he's got tape on me, Javi.<br/>
<br/>
Answer me.<br/>
<br/>
- What?<br/>
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?<br/>
<br/>
- Do you think I would do that to you?<br/>
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?<br/>
<br/>
That your version of ""all in""?<br/>
<br/>
I got one goal: get Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
That's not an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Who gave him the f*cking photos?<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
See you around, Jav.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna go call my wife.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, I have her on the line.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello, my love.<br/>
- Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Look, we're having<br/>
a little problem here.<br/>
<br/>
We're trying to solve it,<br/>
but you know what to do...<br/>
<br/>
if it doesn't work out, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I love you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Me, too.<br/>
<br/>
- Very much.<br/>
- Goodbye, my love.<br/>
<br/>
We are bandits.<br/>
<br/>
- Wait a minute! What is this?<br/>
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!<br/>
<br/>
You've gotta get me out of here,<br/>
do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on.<br/>
<br/>
- Hurry up!<br/>
- Get down! No! Get in there!<br/>
<br/>
Don't move, don't move!<br/>
<br/>
- All clear!<br/>
- All clear!<br/>
<br/>
- Don't move! Don't move!<br/>
- It's me, it's me, it's me.<br/>
<br/>
Keep low, and no matter what happens,<br/>
keep moving.<br/>
<br/>
Speak.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's him.<br/>
<br/>
Speak up, please,<br/>
I can't hear you.<br/>
<br/>
Is that confirmed?<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.<br/>
Sandoval's been freed.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
And Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
- All clear!<br/>
- All clear!<br/>
<br/>
- All clear!<br/>
- All clear!<br/>
<br/>
Look what we found.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think he's OK?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure he's fine.<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Good night.<br/>
<br/>
It's OK... it's OK.<br/>
<br/>
It's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Steve...<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna go home.<br/>
<br/>
This is home.<br/>
<br/>
Less than an hour<br/>
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,<br/>
<br/>
word had spread all over Colombia<br/>
that w*r was coming again.<br/>
<br/>
But this time would be different.<br/>
<br/>
This time,<br/>
there would be no surrender...<br/>
<br/>
no negotiations...<br/>
<br/>
no deals.<br/>
<br/>
This time...<br/>
we were gonna k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar said, ""Better a grave<br/>
in Colombia than a cell in the US.""<br/>
<br/>
Well, guess what, f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
That works for me.</div>]","When the public found out
about the excessive lifestyle

of the prisoners at La Catedral,

the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes

being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.

The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance

of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.

- Agent Peña?
- What's this?

It's from upstairs.

Oh, I get a card.

Oh, CIA.

""Congratulations,
Central Intelligence Agency.""

This is, uh... this is blowing up
a little bit more than we expected, no?

Well, hopefully,
the son of a bitch rots in jail.

Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.

- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?

- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.

Whoever did this, it doesn't really
matter now. What's done is done.

Ambassador, like you said, this is
a Colombian matter. What do we care?

I'm filing a report with the
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.

- Ambassador...
- Good, report to Washington.

'Cause if something isn't done,
every American down here

associated with the government
is gonna look like a fool, including you.

I wasn't finished. Until further notice,
you're both suspended.

Go home.

m*rder AT LA CATEDRAL?

Mr. President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

Moncada's wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

It's clear that Escobar
k*ll those men in that prison.

- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.

But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

Forgive me, Eduardo...

but I'm having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

This is our opportunity
to end Pablo's vacation.

- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.

Ahh!

Good morning, boss.

Bad news.

Have the bodies disappeared?

Our agreement with him states
he can't be moved to another prison.

Excuse me, but k*ll people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

Yes, yes,
but we have to tread carefully.

If he feels we're violating his terms,

he'll start putting b*mb
on street corners again.

Let's tell him we've uncovered thr*at
against him from his biggest enemies.

That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogotá

while we improve security
at La Catedral.

The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.

- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.

Hm.

Can we trust him?

Yes, sir.

Success.

Sure, it cost me a suspension,
but who cares?

I just call it a week's paternity leave.

I was ready to crack a beer
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.

See, because of me and Peña,

the Colombian government
was sending in the army.

Not the cops,
but the f*cking army.

There was no way that Escobar
was getting out of this one.

But, then again, in Colombia...

nothing goes down
the way you think it will.

I'm calling him.

Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.

I was just thinking
there's nothing in the world I'd love more

than to hear my wife's lovely voice.

Pablo, what's happening?

Why would something
be happening here?

The soldiers.

Soldiers?

Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.

I don't know, Pablo.

Tell me what's happening.

No, my love, it's nothing.

Everything is cool.

I'll call back soon, all right?

I love you, baby.

Yes, my love.

Get out the w*apon.

As you wish, sir.

Listen up, company!

You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

Let's secure the perimeter.

Tell your men
they have orders to sh**t anyone

- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.

Dismissed.

- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.

- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!

- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here

to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?

- But the soldiers are going to k*ll him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!

- They're going to k*ll him!
- Quiet!

The car was
outside the garage, still idling,

the keys still in the ignition.

- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?

- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good. Don't.

What? Why not?

Nothing. I just... I don't wanna
ring any alarms before I check things out.

- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...

Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.

I'm gonna take care of this.

I'll find out where he is, all right?

Look, I'll make you a drink.

Boss...

they're gonna
try to take you out of here

and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

If I leave this place,
someone will k*ll me.

Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

What the f*ck,
let's give those bastards lead.

- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

For every one of our men,
they have 20!

- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

Stop bickering in front of the boss.

We have the escape routes.

We could get into the hills
before they even know we're gone.

There is a time to fight...

and there is a time to be clever.

Yes, sir.

- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.

Be smart.

Try to settle this matter peacefully.

If that fails?

What the hell are you doing back here?

- I forgot my socks.
- I want you out in five minutes.

Son of a bitch. These Colombians
are knee-deep in a shit storm.

We gotta talk.

Back here.

What? You get a hooker pregnant?

I think Agent Murphy got snatched.

I checked all area hospitals,
police stations.

We were pursuing leads
on the Cali cartel.

It could be related to that,
or it could be Escobar.

Did you report it
to the Regional Security Office?

If I tell the ROS,
it becomes a five-alarm f*re,

and whoever has him might panic.

If it is Escobar,
he's d*ad already.

Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?

Jesus Christ.

Let me see what I can do.

General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.

- What do you mean, ""legalize"" it?
- Formalize it.

You'll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

We both know that's not true.

But it's what you'll tell Escobar
until he's safely inside a military brig.

Yes, Mr. President.

What's wrong?

I've got a bad feeling about this.

Eduardo, I trust you...

and this is too important to leave
to someone I don't trust completely.

I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

You know that very well.

Nothing will make me happier than to see
that assh*le get the justice he deserves.

Checked my sources with the Colombian
military. Nobody knows jack shit.

So there's no indication Escobar had
anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?

It's time to sound the alarm.

Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?

We call out the troops,
he ends up d*ad like Diana Turbay.

Thanks.

Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet

until further notice, understand?

All right. What else do you have?

- I know that.
- Velasco.

I'll call you back.

Yes, boss?

What's happening outside?

We don't know.

I f*cked up.

What's that, boss?

Gather the boys.

And tell the prison guards they're
to f*re on anyone who tries to come in.

Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

They'd better. I hired them.

Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellín just informed me

that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

Mm.

Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

General!

Let him through.

Good evening, General.

- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?

Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.

- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?

Inside the prison, obviously.

What do you mean,
he's in the prison?

I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

I'm sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

Then what were your orders?

My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

and wait for you.

That's not what the president believes.

He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

I'm sorry,
but those were my orders.

I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.

But since there is
no justice in this country,

he is the vice minister of nothing.

This is good.

Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

This is very good.

General, I don't believe
you understand your orders clearly.

- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

I'm going to try
to make a miracle happen.

I'm going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to k*ll the vice minister of justice

right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.

At least let me make a call
so they don't sh**t you when you walk in!

Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

Didn't you hear me?
Open the door! General!

Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

Open it.

Vice Minister, good evening.

Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

Wait here.

Good evening, Vice Minister.

It's been a while.

Good evening.

I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.

My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.

The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

for your safety
and everyone else's here.

Mm.

I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

But I didn't k*ll those men.
That story is a lie.

And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

We have an agreement,
and you're breaking it.

What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won't kidnap me

and take me to the US?

Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right?

That's not gonna happen,
you have my word.

- Your word.
- Mm.

As vice minister of justice?

Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

Haven't you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

We can end this peacefully...

if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

Don Pablo,
these bastards will k*ll you!

I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

The press is saying I k*ll those men,
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.

If Gaviria wants me out of here...

he can come here...
and do it himself.

Meanwhile...

I'll view any incursion
as a declaration of w*r.

I'll inform the president
of your position.

Excuse me.

Mr. Vice Minister.

Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

I'd rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

Let me out!

Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

I hope you'll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

It's not every day we're honored with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

Come on, Vice Minister.

Calm down, let's go.

Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?

Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.

What the f*ck does that mean?
Doing what?

I'm sorry.

Just trying to hold it together.

God, I just wanna go home.

I want my husband back.

- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.

No.

You're just not sure he's d*ad.

What's taking this guy so long?

General, with all due respect,

I don't think we should've
let him go inside.

No.

I don't think Pablo is stupid enough
to f*ck with the vice minister.

Can I get you something to drink?

I don't need anything.

Look, don't be so nervous.

As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

that if he doesn't remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

there will be grave consequences.

But if he withdraws the troops,

we'll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

Good evening,
President Gaviria's office.

It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.

One minute, please.

Mr. President,
excuse the interruption.

There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.

Hello?

Hello?

How long will I be here
as a hostage?

You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

Escobar has Sandoval
inside the prison.

Hang up right now,
Mr. President.

- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.

Mr. President,
hang up the phone.

If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might k*ll Eduardo.

Hang up the phone. Sir!

Leave us alone.

- They hung up.
- Bullshit.

Shut up!

So, then...

the president is too busy
to speak with me.

I don't understand
how he ended up in that jail.

Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.

What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.

Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

Do I have your permission?

Good.

María Clara, connect me
with DAS, immediately.

- No. No.
- Cancel the call.

- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.

If Sandoval dies...

I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.

I just realized something.

The president didn't just betray me...

he also betrayed you.

He knew if you came here...
Look at me.

...there would be three options.

One: I leave with you, peacefully.

Two: I take you hostage.

Three: I sh**t you,

and then, he really would
have a good excuse to k*ll me.

Right?

Either way, he wins.
Right?

Maybe the president
is betraying us both.

You could be right.

But you know something?

I'll sacrifice my life
to make sure you're d*ad.

You think you're better than me,
but you're wrong.

I come from nothing.

I fought hard
to become what I am.

If the government
hadn't come after me...

I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.

You and I are nothing alike.

You are a criminal.

And criminals can't run forever.

Sir.

Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

while you're still inside.

I would have done the same thing.

Don't k*ll him.

If he dies... it will be
at the hands of his own government.

Good luck, Vice Minister.

Now what?

I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.

Damn right we do.

Hey, partner.

Remember how I told you
that no one in their right mind

would ever k*ll a DEA agent?

Well, to be honest,
after they snatched me,

I'd forgotten that, myself.

But then, I calmed down and realized
that if they wanted to k*ll me,

they would've blown my brains out
right in front of my house.

This... was something different.

I figured this was Escobar
knowing that they were coming to get him,

and grabbing
a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.

Sit.

Man, you f*cked up. You think
that they're gonna make a trade for me?

No. No!

They're gonna storm that bullshit f*ck'
prison and blow his f*ck' head off!

I'm sorry
you were taken against your will,

but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,
given your last meeting with Navegante.

Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see
your Cali cartel is doing so well,

but you've made a huge mistake.

I don't see it that way.

I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking
the liberty of making you a cocktail.

I just learned how to do a really
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.

That's wonderful,
but I don't want your f*ck' daiquiri.

You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.

Fine. I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.

I thought you might
like to see some pictures I have.

Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo

to ID a location
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.

Two hours later, they were d*ad.

Along with an innocent woman.

OK.

Poison will be at La Dispensaria

at around midnight with his crew.

Who's your contact at the embassy?

Did you know she had two kids?

What do you think our newspapers
will think of that?

Our government doesn't take too kindly
to American-backed death squads.

I could blackmail you
with these pictures.

You'd lose your career at the DEA,

go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.

But don't worry.

I won't ask you or Javier Peña

to cross any line
you haven't already crossed.

So you think the DEA and Cali cartel
would be a good match.

There are many,
in every segment of Colombia,

who have been persecuted
by Pablo Escobar.

The families of Moncada and Galeano,

the families of judges and police...

people with resources
who need to be unified.

They want vengeance.

- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.

I can't make any commitments right now.

But I can tell you this:

When Pablo goes down,
and he will go down...

you'll hear a knock at your door,

and it'll be me.

You haven't tried my daiquiri.

That Herrera's a pretty good host.

Makes a mean cocktail, gives you
door-to-door service right to the embassy.

- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?

What'd he say?

You f*ck' gave him that information.

He's got pictures on me,
he's got tape on me, Javi.

Answer me.

- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?

- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?

That your version of ""all in""?

I got one goal: get Escobar.

That's not an answer.

Who gave him the f*cking photos?

Hey.

See you around, Jav.

I'm gonna go call my wife.

Sir, I have her on the line.

- Hello, my love.
- Hello.

Look, we're having
a little problem here.

We're trying to solve it,
but you know what to do...

if it doesn't work out, right?

Yes, Pablo.

I love you very much.

Me, too.

- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.

We are bandits.

- Wait a minute! What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!

You've gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

Come on, come on.

- Hurry up!
- Get down! No! Get in there!

Don't move, don't move!

- All clear!
- All clear!

- Don't move! Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

Speak.

Yes, it's him.

Speak up, please,
I can't hear you.

Is that confirmed?

Wait a minute.

Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.

Gentlemen, gentlemen.

And Escobar?

- All clear!
- All clear!

- All clear!
- All clear!

Look what we found.

Do you think he's OK?

I'm sure he's fine.

See you tomorrow.

Good night.

It's OK... it's OK.

It's OK.

Steve...

I just wanna go home.

This is home.

Less than an hour
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,

word had spread all over Colombia
that w*r was coming again.

But this time would be different.

This time,
there would be no surrender...

no negotiations...

no deals.

This time...
we were gonna k*ll him.

Escobar said, ""Better a grave
in Colombia than a cell in the US.""

Well, guess what, f*ck?

That works for me."
01x09 - La Catedral,"[<div class=""content"">Good morning, Sergeant.<br/>
<br/>
Good morning, Paisa. What have you got for us?<br/>
<br/>
I've got plumbing valves, a bunch of clean towels,<br/>
<br/>
and extra uniforms for the guards.<br/>
<br/>
Let him go. He's been checked.<br/>
<br/>
Continue. Continue, Paisa.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sergeant.<br/>
<br/>
- Good day. - Good day.<br/>
<br/>
- Good day, Paisa. - Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,<br/>
<br/>
but we nicknamed it ""Club Medellín.""<br/>
<br/>
It was the embodiment of ""the big lie.""<br/>
<br/>
It was even built to look old and shitty on the outside.<br/>
<br/>
But inside, it was anything but.<br/>
<br/>
The other inmates? Escobar's sicarios.<br/>
<br/>
Hand-picked k*ll from his hometown.<br/>
<br/>
You're here, my friend!<br/>
<br/>
- How you doing, Velasco? - Good, brother. How was the trip?<br/>
<br/>
Fine, fine. What a long drive!<br/>
<br/>
- Really? - It's really hot.<br/>
<br/>
Did you encounter any problems?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.<br/>
<br/>
I brought everything, including the special items requested by Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on, buddy? - Blackie!<br/>
<br/>
- I thought you forgot about us. - Let me show you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God. All right, boys! Get a ladder over here!<br/>
<br/>
The sicarios weren't the only guys in the prison who worked for Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
The guards did, too.<br/>
<br/>
- Welcome to La Catedral. - Hello.<br/>
<br/>
- Come on down, ladies.<br/>
<br/>
We'll take care of you.<br/>
<br/>
By the terms of his deal,<br/>
<br/>
no cops or military were allowed within two miles of the prison.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I f*cking hated this guy, I had to hand it to him...<br/>
<br/>
he had a pretty sweet deal.<br/>
<br/>
Come on! Hurry up! What? Is it heavy?<br/>
<br/>
- That looks delicious, Paisa. - All right, lobsters.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar hadn't built himself a prison at all.<br/>
<br/>
He'd built himself a fortress.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter how you decorate it... a cage is still a cage.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, boss.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a report.<br/>
<br/>
Moncada and Galeano are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos<br/>
<br/>
through Mexico and the Caribbean.<br/>
<br/>
Did they pay the w*r tax?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, boss, but ever since you settled things with the government,<br/>
<br/>
a lot of other people have been complaining.<br/>
<br/>
My expenses in and out of the prison must be covered by everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Understood.<br/>
<br/>
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel are preparing for a ceasefire.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
As am I.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to negotiate a truce.<br/>
<br/>
But first, we're going to k*ll a few of his men.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel is going to take that as an act of w*r,<br/>
<br/>
don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of w*r...<br/>
<br/>
is peace.<br/>
<br/>
If there was one benefit to Escobar's imprisonment,<br/>
<br/>
it's that peace had finally come to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Connie and I took advantage and began adoption proceedings.<br/>
<br/>
The w*r had left many orphans.<br/>
<br/>
One... we could do something about.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you like the pink ones, don't you? Yeah, you do.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, orchids, look!<br/>
<br/>
What's this one? ""Cattleya.""<br/>
<br/>
It means ""graceful."" Hm.<br/>
<br/>
- That describes me perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, buying baby things and plants for the apartment...<br/>
<br/>
we're a family.<br/>
<br/>
We're domesticated animals.<br/>
<br/>
- You want this one? - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
- You want that one? Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
How about Elizabeth?<br/>
<br/>
After my mother? Are you kidding?<br/>
<br/>
What is ""Elizabeth"" in Spanish? Is it ""Isabel""? Isabel's nice.<br/>
<br/>
- I've always liked ""Olivia."" - Olivia's OK.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Shit!<br/>
<br/>
- What's the deal? - Steve...<br/>
<br/>
Look what you've done to my car.<br/>
<br/>
- Where? - Look at this traffic jam.<br/>
<br/>
- Look what you did to my car! - Ah! It's nothing.<br/>
<br/>
- How am I gonna drive this? - It's nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the f*cking traffic jam this is causing.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, man!<br/>
<br/>
And you don't even speak Spanish? Get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't mess with me, assh*le. - Easy, man.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me? What the hell have you come here for, f*g?<br/>
<br/>
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch. So that's it, then.<br/>
<br/>
What, are you gonna hit me? You and who else?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my...<br/>
<br/>
OK, take it easy. It's all right. It's OK now.<br/>
<br/>
- Calm down, assh*le. - OK?<br/>
<br/>
- Relax, man. OK. - OK?<br/>
<br/>
OK, calm down.<br/>
<br/>
Have some tolerance.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I like ""Olivia.""<br/>
<br/>
- Do you hear that? - What?<br/>
<br/>
People. Children. Laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Even the vendors are back out.<br/>
<br/>
And all because we gave Escobar the keys to his own prison.<br/>
<br/>
You did the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
You think?<br/>
<br/>
You should be happy.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, people can return to their normal lives.<br/>
<br/>
Finally... we are at peace.<br/>
<br/>
We spoke with Pablo, and he is willing to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
Ten of my men have just been k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
Is that how you guys begin negotiations?<br/>
<br/>
Two things, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
First... Mr. Galeano and I had nothing to do with those deaths.<br/>
<br/>
And the second thing... this is w*r, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
There are deaths everywhere, and we have casualties as well.<br/>
<br/>
We are willing to pay three million dollars<br/>
<br/>
- to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo won't accept anything under $12 million, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve million is nothing to you.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to know something?<br/>
<br/>
It's over.<br/>
<br/>
What's over?<br/>
<br/>
- The Medellín cartel.<br/>
<br/>
No, you're wrong, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
We export twice the amount you do.<br/>
<br/>
You invited me here to give me this line of bullshit?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo put a w*r tax on the two of you for $250,000 a month.<br/>
<br/>
That's how he treats his friends and associates?<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget that, thanks to Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,<br/>
<br/>
extradition was abolished. That serves you very well, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
He was the one who got us into this mess.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll politicians and cops, b*mb street corners and airplanes.<br/>
<br/>
He started this f*cking w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Are we going to negotiate or not?<br/>
<br/>
As part of Escobar's surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,<br/>
<br/>
and Colonel Carrillo was transferred out of the country.<br/>
<br/>
For the time being, Carrillo's w*r was over.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see why they're sending you to Spain.<br/>
<br/>
It's not like the cocaine w*r is over.<br/>
<br/>
Galeano and Moncada are fronting for Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
My superiors say I play too rough.<br/>
<br/>
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can leave knowing you helped put him there.<br/>
<br/>
Jail?<br/>
<br/>
I know you gringos aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...<br/>
<br/>
I got some photographs, courtesy of the Colombian military.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to look at 'em, tell me if this qualifies as a jail.<br/>
<br/>
He's got a f*cking soccer field.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.<br/>
<br/>
Without the Colombian government breathing down his neck,<br/>
<br/>
all he's gotta worry about is the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Let's face it, fellas...<br/>
<br/>
he won.<br/>
<br/>
We're here, gentlemen!<br/>
<br/>
- Gentlemen! - What a bumpy ride, Paisa.<br/>
<br/>
Where did you learn to drive?<br/>
<br/>
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
This takes care of the problem we had in LA and ends the w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a good proposition.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what this means, boss?<br/>
<br/>
We can maintain our infrastructure and the government won't be the wiser.<br/>
<br/>
That way, we can... double our exports in less than a month, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
How did he behave...<br/>
<br/>
when he offered you the money?<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, ""how did he behave""?<br/>
<br/>
What was his attitude?<br/>
<br/>
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Respectful in what way?<br/>
<br/>
- He wants peace, just like us. - Yes, but...<br/>
<br/>
how did he react when you told him our solution?<br/>
<br/>
In a positive manner.<br/>
<br/>
He just offered you the money, just like that?<br/>
<br/>
Well... he started at three million dollars. Right?<br/>
<br/>
- Mm. - But we said no,<br/>
<br/>
and told him you wouldn't take less than 12.<br/>
<br/>
So he offered ten, and we felt that was a fair deal.<br/>
<br/>
Offered you three million?<br/>
<br/>
He was feeling us out. He knew we wouldn't accept that.<br/>
<br/>
If he really respected me, he would be grateful if I accepted 20.<br/>
<br/>
That's right, boss. Ask for 20. In one sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him I'm not happy with less than 30.<br/>
<br/>
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Thirty million... if Cali wants peace.<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
I also need to raise the w*r tax.<br/>
<br/>
From now on, a million a month,<br/>
<br/>
for both of you... and all our other partners.<br/>
<br/>
Good move beating him, you son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
If we get proof that Escobar is violating the terms of his surrender,<br/>
<br/>
then they have to send him to a real prison,<br/>
<br/>
but we need more than these aerial shots.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get us satellite communications or wire intercepts?<br/>
<br/>
There's a no-fly zone over the prison, with antiaircraft g*n<br/>
<br/>
manned by the Colombian army to enforce it.<br/>
<br/>
You're playing with f*re if Noonan finds out.<br/>
<br/>
We don't got shit on him without intercepts.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't need 'em. - What? The hell we don't.<br/>
<br/>
They're not using phones.<br/>
<br/>
- The hell is that? - I could spot a coop a mile away.<br/>
<br/>
That's how they're sending messages.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid our high-tech spy planes,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo chose the most low-tech form of communication.<br/>
<br/>
Never said the guy wasn't crafty.<br/>
<br/>
- You see anything yet? - No, man.<br/>
<br/>
You're blind as a bat. Give me those.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, one's goin'.<br/>
<br/>
- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low. - I got it.<br/>
<br/>
- You got it? - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Low.<br/>
<br/>
Ah...<br/>
<br/>
That's a fast f*cking pigeon.<br/>
<br/>
Give me the g*n.<br/>
<br/>
- You trying to say I'm a lousy sh*t? - Yes, I am saying you're a lousy sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
Here.<br/>
<br/>
You're a shit sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
- Heads up, heads up. - I got it.<br/>
<br/>
- One o'clock. - I got it.<br/>
<br/>
sh**t.<br/>
<br/>
sh**t!<br/>
<br/>
Ever been duck huntin'?<br/>
<br/>
No, I have not been duck hunting, you... f*cking hillbilly.<br/>
<br/>
- Bingo.<br/>
<br/>
It's in Spanish. Read it.<br/>
<br/>
""Delivery due with El Paisa in the tunnel.""<br/>
<br/>
The son of a bitch built a tunnel under the jail.<br/>
<br/>
We talked with Pablo and reached an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
- Mm-hm? - Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
We agreed to...<br/>
<br/>
- one million dollars. - What?<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
What about the house in Cartagena?<br/>
<br/>
That's not happening, right?<br/>
<br/>
Do you want your house in Cartagena?<br/>
<br/>
- Of course. - OK... you will have it.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you see things are improving?<br/>
<br/>
No, I see things are getting more complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of getting better... things are getting worse.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what about this w*r tax he's charging you?<br/>
<br/>
$250,000 was a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
And now a million? Ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think I should do? Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?<br/>
<br/>
- Obviously not. - Then I don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you want me to do? - It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I... adore Pablo. I adore him.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing is, I don't know what's going on with him these days.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Maybe he's depressed.<br/>
<br/>
We're here in a Jacuzzi...<br/>
<br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you love me? - Oh...<br/>
<br/>
Stop f*cking around. You make me angry.<br/>
<br/>
Against orders, we did high-altitude flyovers of the prison<br/>
<br/>
- with our infrared cameras. - No tunnels.<br/>
<br/>
Tomography report indicates nothing. Seismic measuring, nada.<br/>
<br/>
Can we measure radio frequency energy?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we could try. Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.<br/>
<br/>
If he's bringing shit into this tunnel, you can bet he's going out that way.<br/>
<br/>
If there's a tunnel there, he must have dug it to China.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can...<br/>
<br/>
We can ask the military to do light detection and ranging.<br/>
<br/>
We got a better chance of Noonan authorizing a divining rod.<br/>
<br/>
- All right, man, I'm calling it a night. - Nah, finish up.<br/>
<br/>
No, you can't even smoke in here.<br/>
<br/>
No luck?<br/>
<br/>
These aerials don't indicate a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.<br/>
<br/>
Hm.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the only thing I can see in all of them is this truck.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you finished with that, honey? - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
Did it stop?<br/>
<br/>
Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up? - Are you ""The Paisa""?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes. - Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.<br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor and get out of the truck.<br/>
<br/>
- What's going on? - Don't be afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Up against the truck.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Do me another favor.<br/>
<br/>
Open it up.<br/>
<br/>
Go on.<br/>
<br/>
We missed a very important delivery.<br/>
<br/>
Sex toys, back issues of Hustler, a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.<br/>
<br/>
He's bored shitless in there.<br/>
<br/>
Look, gringos... you don't have the right to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we have the right.<br/>
<br/>
You just press the button in the truck and we will do the rest, OK?<br/>
<br/>
If the boss finds out that I let you put cameras in the truck, he'll k*ll me.<br/>
<br/>
What did he say?<br/>
<br/>
He says if Pablo finds out, he'll k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
Amigo...<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's your boss?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I am your boss. Yes?<br/>
<br/>
It's OK, it's OK! I'll do whatever you say.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Are you OK, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Good day.<br/>
<br/>
So what is this? What am I looking at exactly?<br/>
<br/>
- Club Medellín. - This was all shipped in to La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
We got some big-screen TVs, nice stereo equipment.<br/>
<br/>
That's a roulette wheel, a little bit of liquor.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see the judges could come down with the official from the airport.<br/>
<br/>
Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget the jukebox with the hookers.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the lobster.<br/>
<br/>
- This is a-- - Yes, it's a roulette wheel.<br/>
<br/>
He has a casino right there at La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
- Where did you get these pictures? - From the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
It's not just these pictures.<br/>
<br/>
They also have pictures of judges, local government people,<br/>
<br/>
other narcos, prost*tute... Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Who else has seen these? - No one, as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
- That's why we have to act now.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the DEA is capable of leaking the photos to the media?<br/>
<br/>
The DEA is capable of anything. That's why we have to do something now.<br/>
<br/>
At one time, Escobar... used to own all of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Now he's just the owner of his own prison.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to choose between prost*tute at La Catedral...<br/>
<br/>
or b*mb in the country...<br/>
<br/>
I would be eternally grateful to these women.<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday, Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
- Watch your step. - Careful with the little girl!<br/>
<br/>
How are you? Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
- Happy birthday. - Hello, sweetheart.<br/>
<br/>
They're the ones I hired? I don't believe you.<br/>
<br/>
They are really good, Blackie. I like them.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Pablo, tell us... what are you doing these days? Hm!<br/>
<br/>
- How do you spend your time? - Aside from missing his family?<br/>
<br/>
Oh! Of course.<br/>
<br/>
- He's writing a book. - Mm!<br/>
<br/>
- Mother. - What?<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it true? You are writing a book.<br/>
<br/>
Please, Mom.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then, you tell them.<br/>
<br/>
- It's a collection of magazine articles. - Many articles.<br/>
<br/>
- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons. - Oh, cartoons!<br/>
<br/>
From newspapers and magazines all over the world.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what? People write him every day.<br/>
<br/>
- It's because they love him. - I can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
You have to find ways to keep your mind occupied around here.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband and Galeano to help you with the business.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, on that note, Kiko is so grateful to you<br/>
<br/>
for all the responsibilities you have given him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
- We were in Cartagena-- - Where?<br/>
<br/>
- We were in Cartagena last week. - Oh, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes, we spent some beautiful days there relaxing.<br/>
<br/>
It must feel good to be able to relax like that.<br/>
<br/>
- How nice. - Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.<br/>
<br/>
But I'll tell you, Cartagena is really expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's unaffordable.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, this whole ""w*r with Cali"" thing,<br/>
<br/>
it's tough, you know, with the tax we have to pay.<br/>
<br/>
We understand it's not easy, but there's not much we can do.<br/>
<br/>
It's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Kiko complained about that?<br/>
<br/>
He mentioned it.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't complain, Pablo, he didn't complain.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone here is absolutely aware of the huge sacrifice that you're making,<br/>
<br/>
for God's sake. So I think it's normal, right?<br/>
<br/>
It's normal that we'd give you our support.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think it's normal... I really do.<br/>
<br/>
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad for a little while, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Honey, you should play with the kids a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the gift here.<br/>
<br/>
I'll look after it.<br/>
<br/>
The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo was right. He won.<br/>
<br/>
What are those?<br/>
<br/>
These are a list of, uh... my accomplishments.<br/>
<br/>
You shred these.<br/>
<br/>
Apologize!<br/>
<br/>
Apologize!<br/>
<br/>
Apologize!<br/>
<br/>
- Were you watching? - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
You apologize!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, boss.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean it.<br/>
<br/>
- Relax. - Are you all right, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Relax. That's how the game goes.<br/>
<br/>
Go on, go on. You guys continue.<br/>
<br/>
Are you all right, sir?<br/>
<br/>
Boss.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, boss, but I need to speak to you.<br/>
<br/>
Everything OK?<br/>
<br/>
- Boss, we have a problem. - What problem?<br/>
<br/>
You remember that Moncada and Galeano had a large shipment<br/>
<br/>
- that was seized in Boyacá? - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
- 250 kilos. - Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine, a farmer found three million dollars buried in a field?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where that was, boss?<br/>
<br/>
In Rionegro.<br/>
<br/>
True story. And pay attention, because it changes a lot of lives.<br/>
<br/>
Remember how I told you that the cartel was making so much money<br/>
<br/>
that they had to bury it?<br/>
<br/>
And Blackbeard had the treasure map.<br/>
<br/>
Well, after we got him, he gave a lot of it up...<br/>
<br/>
but not all of it.<br/>
<br/>
It just so happens that one day, out in a field in Rionegro,<br/>
<br/>
a farmer who worked for Galeano and Moncada found one.<br/>
<br/>
At first, the poor guy thought he'd dug up a body.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, plenty of 'em had been buried out in the fields.<br/>
<br/>
The farmer knew right away it was narco money.<br/>
<br/>
He was terrified he might get buried himself if he took it.<br/>
<br/>
So he took the money to a guy who was connected,<br/>
<br/>
who took it to another guy...<br/>
<br/>
who took it to Pablo's sicario lieutenant... Velasco.<br/>
<br/>
There's cash buried everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
The guerillas, the paramilitary, the narcos...<br/>
<br/>
- Everybody's burying cash. - Yes, I know.<br/>
<br/>
But right on Moncada and Galeano's property?<br/>
<br/>
Don't you think that's strange, boss?<br/>
<br/>
I think it's strange.<br/>
<br/>
Look. All this cash...<br/>
<br/>
was found... in a field.<br/>
<br/>
- That's good luck, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could be bad luck. For you both.<br/>
<br/>
It was on your property, in Rionegro.<br/>
<br/>
But Pablo, those lands are over 300 acres,<br/>
<br/>
and most of us rent out to the farmers.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
You told me that you had a 250-kilo shipment seized.<br/>
<br/>
That's true.<br/>
<br/>
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.<br/>
<br/>
Who told you to open your mouth?<br/>
<br/>
Not true? Hm?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, do you think we're stealing from you?<br/>
<br/>
That we made up that whole story about the seizure?<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like, check with the cops in Boyacá.<br/>
<br/>
Right, because cops in Boyacá are so honest, right?<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that we bought that property from Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
I even remember Gustavo saying that you had cash stashed in every corner.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo... would never forget where he buried cash.<br/>
<br/>
Who's putting this shit in your head, Pablo? These assholes?<br/>
<br/>
These f*ck would sell their own mother.<br/>
<br/>
- We are partners and friends. - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that cash was lost because I raised the tax?<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit. I paid the tax and never complained.<br/>
<br/>
That's a lie.<br/>
<br/>
- Because you complained to your wife. - I haven't complained.<br/>
<br/>
You have no idea what I talk about with Judy.<br/>
<br/>
I understand this is difficult for you, Pablo--<br/>
<br/>
What is difficult for me?<br/>
<br/>
Well, managing all of this. That's why you hired us.<br/>
<br/>
- So we can manage it and look after it. - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
You trust us, right?<br/>
<br/>
I understand this makes you anxious--<br/>
<br/>
- Do I look anxious? - No, I didn't mean that.<br/>
<br/>
- You said with certainty that-- - No, no, what I meant to say was--<br/>
<br/>
- I think you're the one who's anxious. - We didn't do shit, Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
With that tone of yours... you're telling me you didn't do shit?<br/>
<br/>
Like I was some kind of idiot. Is this my cash or not?!<br/>
<br/>
No, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Did you take it and bury it in Rionegro or not?!<br/>
<br/>
For sure, these guys hid your cash, boss.<br/>
<br/>
- It's the truth, you pair of liars. - Of course, he--<br/>
<br/>
- Shut up, f*ck! - You're petty thieves!<br/>
<br/>
You shut up, f*ck! Don't you disrespect me!<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, look at me, man.<br/>
<br/>
We're family.<br/>
<br/>
You're my daughter's godfather.<br/>
<br/>
And also godfather to Galeano's kids.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
We're like brothers.<br/>
<br/>
We're partners and friends.<br/>
<br/>
We've been in this our whole lives, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
We made our first trip to Miami together.<br/>
<br/>
We made so much cash together that we don't even know what we spent it on.<br/>
<br/>
What's the problem?<br/>
<br/>
What's happening?<br/>
<br/>
The two of us love you very much.<br/>
<br/>
And we're very grateful.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Being stuck in here...<br/>
<br/>
can make someone paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
- Paisa! Paisa!<br/>
<br/>
Well, man, these things happen, right?<br/>
<br/>
We're here for whatever you need. Trust us.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bring you a few little things to keep you entertained, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!<br/>
<br/>
You're a dog, you son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
What does it feel like to take a shit on your own empire?<br/>
<br/>
You want us to tell you that we stole the money?<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day, you'll believe whatever you want, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye, Kiko.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll me if you're such a man, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll me with your own f*cking hands!<br/>
<br/>
Who are you talking to, assh*le?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Wait a second!<br/>
<br/>
Be careful, man.<br/>
<br/>
Look what the d*ad guy gave me.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck! You're going to burn all the meat!<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong with you? Can't you see I'm doing it to cover the smell?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all. - What are we gonna do with all this meat?<br/>
<br/>
- What are you going to do? - What am I supposed to do?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
Boss, are you OK?<br/>
<br/>
Do you need anything, boss?<br/>
<br/>
We're grilling some meat. Do you want some?<br/>
<br/>
No. I'm not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
Boss.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you want me to wax it? - No, relax.<br/>
<br/>
This one's my favorite. I enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
This is a beautiful car.<br/>
<br/>
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.<br/>
<br/>
It's a shame.<br/>
<br/>
I warned them.<br/>
<br/>
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Do you still have that DEA contact?<br/>
<br/>
Javier Peña? Of course.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to contact him and confirm the rumors.<br/>
<br/>
They're just as interested in screwing Escobar as we are.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I've called everyone. I'm so worried.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo told me that they left La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
Just relax, sweetie.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband is fine.<br/>
<br/>
No. No, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe... they had to go somewhere else urgently?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe they left without saying anything.<br/>
<br/>
The way our men usually do.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but it's a little strange, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
Kiko was very clear that he had a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
He said he would be home later.<br/>
<br/>
We're trying to have another baby. I think I told you that.<br/>
<br/>
No? We're trying to have another baby, and the time is right,<br/>
<br/>
so we had a very important date to keep.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure that Pablo told you that Kiko left La Catedral?<br/>
<br/>
Are you telling me that my husband is a liar?<br/>
<br/>
I want my husband back.<br/>
<br/>
If Pablo told Tata that they left...<br/>
<br/>
it's because they left.<br/>
<br/>
Listen... Pablo is your kids' godfather.<br/>
<br/>
He would never hurt them.<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
There are rumors that he k*ll Galeano and Moncada.<br/>
<br/>
Where, in jail?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
""In jail.""<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't make any sense. They're partners.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there is not such thing as sense with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit. Where'd you get it?<br/>
<br/>
The relatives of the men he k*ll... are up in arms.<br/>
<br/>
The poor fellows went in, but they never got out.<br/>
<br/>
I want to ask you gentlemen a serious question now.<br/>
<br/>
How bad do you want Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
How far are you willing to go in this matter?<br/>
<br/>
What are you proposing?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we both have access to information that could benefit the other.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
No, we don't trade information.<br/>
<br/>
- Just hold on a second. - No.<br/>
<br/>
He's an informant, Javi.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you got cookin', it stinks. I don't want it.<br/>
<br/>
Appreciate the tip. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Your partner here...<br/>
<br/>
may need some convincing now.<br/>
<br/>
Moncada and Galeano going into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.<br/>
<br/>
Every return from this day forward...<br/>
<br/>
no Moncada, no Galeano.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, we couldn't have cared less about a couple of d*ad narcos.<br/>
<br/>
It meant more chaos and confusion in the Medellín cartel.<br/>
<br/>
But we wanted Escobar out of that piece of shit excuse for a jail,<br/>
<br/>
in a real prison, not a fortress...<br/>
<br/>
where his enemies could get payback.<br/>
<br/>
You sure?<br/>
<br/>
We can either play politics or we can do the job.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we were never any good at playing politics anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
These photos are worth looking into.<br/>
<br/>
And believe me, I'm going to.<br/>
<br/>
If it's true, this is gonna cause a shit storm, you know?<br/>
<br/>
- Be right back. - Gracias.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
f*ck President Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck Noonan.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck La Catedral.<br/>
<br/>
And f*ck Pablo.</div>]","Good morning, Sergeant.

Good morning, Paisa. What have you got for us?

I've got plumbing valves, a bunch of clean towels,

and extra uniforms for the guards.

Let him go. He's been checked.

Continue. Continue, Paisa.

Thank you, Sergeant.

- Good day. - Good day.

- Good day, Paisa. - Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,

but we nicknamed it ""Club Medellín.""

It was the embodiment of ""the big lie.""

It was even built to look old and shitty on the outside.

But inside, it was anything but.

The other inmates? Escobar's sicarios.

Hand-picked k*ll from his hometown.

You're here, my friend!

- How you doing, Velasco? - Good, brother. How was the trip?

Fine, fine. What a long drive!

- Really? - It's really hot.

Did you encounter any problems?

Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

I brought everything, including the special items requested by Pablo.

- What's going on, buddy? - Blackie!

- I thought you forgot about us. - Let me show you.

Oh, my God. All right, boys! Get a ladder over here!

The sicarios weren't the only guys in the prison who worked for Escobar.

The guards did, too.

- Welcome to La Catedral. - Hello.

- Come on down, ladies.

We'll take care of you.

By the terms of his deal,

no cops or military were allowed within two miles of the prison.

As much as I f*cking hated this guy, I had to hand it to him...

he had a pretty sweet deal.

Come on! Hurry up! What? Is it heavy?

- That looks delicious, Paisa. - All right, lobsters.

Escobar hadn't built himself a prison at all.

He'd built himself a fortress.

But no matter how you decorate it... a cage is still a cage.

Excuse me, boss.

I've got a report.

Moncada and Galeano are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

through Mexico and the Caribbean.

Did they pay the w*r tax?

Yes, boss, but ever since you settled things with the government,

a lot of other people have been complaining.

My expenses in and out of the prison must be covered by everyone.

Understood.

Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel are preparing for a ceasefire.

Mm.

As am I.

We're going to negotiate a truce.

But first, we're going to k*ll a few of his men.

I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel is going to take that as an act of w*r,

don't you think?

The purpose of w*r...

is peace.

If there was one benefit to Escobar's imprisonment,

it's that peace had finally come to Bogotá.

Connie and I took advantage and began adoption proceedings.

The w*r had left many orphans.

One... we could do something about.

Oh, you like the pink ones, don't you? Yeah, you do.

Oh, orchids, look!

What's this one? ""Cattleya.""

It means ""graceful."" Hm.

- That describes me perfectly.

Oh, buying baby things and plants for the apartment...

we're a family.

We're domesticated animals.

- You want this one? - Yeah.

- You want that one? Yeah.

How about Elizabeth?

After my mother? Are you kidding?

What is ""Elizabeth"" in Spanish? Is it ""Isabel""? Isabel's nice.

- I've always liked ""Olivia."" - Olivia's OK.

f*ck.

- Shit!

- What's the deal? - Steve...

Look what you've done to my car.

- Where? - Look at this traffic jam.

- Look what you did to my car! - Ah! It's nothing.

- How am I gonna drive this? - It's nothing.

Look at the f*cking traffic jam this is causing.

Yeah, man!

And you don't even speak Spanish? Get out of here.

- Don't mess with me, assh*le. - Easy, man.

Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me? What the hell have you come here for, f*g?

I deserve respect, you son of a bitch. So that's it, then.

What, are you gonna hit me? You and who else?

Oh, my...

OK, take it easy. It's all right. It's OK now.

- Calm down, assh*le. - OK?

- Relax, man. OK. - OK?

OK, calm down.

Have some tolerance.

Yeah, I like ""Olivia.""

- Do you hear that? - What?

People. Children. Laughter.

Even the vendors are back out.

And all because we gave Escobar the keys to his own prison.

You did the right thing.

You think?

You should be happy.

Finally, people can return to their normal lives.

Finally... we are at peace.

We spoke with Pablo, and he is willing to negotiate.

Ten of my men have just been k*ll.

Is that how you guys begin negotiations?

Two things, Pacho.

First... Mr. Galeano and I had nothing to do with those deaths.

And the second thing... this is w*r, Pacho.

There are deaths everywhere, and we have casualties as well.

We are willing to pay three million dollars

- to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.

Pablo won't accept anything under $12 million, Pacho.

Twelve million is nothing to you.

Do you want to know something?

It's over.

What's over?

- The Medellín cartel.

No, you're wrong, Pacho.

We export twice the amount you do.

You invited me here to give me this line of bullshit?

Pablo put a w*r tax on the two of you for $250,000 a month.

That's how he treats his friends and associates?

Don't forget that, thanks to Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

extradition was abolished. That serves you very well, doesn't it?

He was the one who got us into this mess.

k*ll politicians and cops, b*mb street corners and airplanes.

He started this f*cking w*r.

Are we going to negotiate or not?

As part of Escobar's surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,

and Colonel Carrillo was transferred out of the country.

For the time being, Carrillo's w*r was over.

I don't see why they're sending you to Spain.

It's not like the cocaine w*r is over.

Galeano and Moncada are fronting for Escobar.

My superiors say I play too rough.

At least Escobar is in jail and... you can leave knowing you helped put him there.

Jail?

I know you gringos aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...

I got some photographs, courtesy of the Colombian military.

I want you to look at 'em, tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

He's got a f*cking soccer field.

Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

Without the Colombian government breathing down his neck,

all he's gotta worry about is the Cali cartel.

Let's face it, fellas...

he won.

We're here, gentlemen!

- Gentlemen! - What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

Where did you learn to drive?

We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

This takes care of the problem we had in LA and ends the w*r.

Sounds like a good proposition.

Do you know what this means, boss?

We can maintain our infrastructure and the government won't be the wiser.

That way, we can... double our exports in less than a month, Pablo.

How did he behave...

when he offered you the money?

What do you mean, ""how did he behave""?

What was his attitude?

Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

Respectful in what way?

- He wants peace, just like us. - Yes, but...

how did he react when you told him our solution?

In a positive manner.

He just offered you the money, just like that?

Well... he started at three million dollars. Right?

- Mm. - But we said no,

and told him you wouldn't take less than 12.

So he offered ten, and we felt that was a fair deal.

Offered you three million?

He was feeling us out. He knew we wouldn't accept that.

If he really respected me, he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

That's right, boss. Ask for 20. In one sh*t.

Tell him I'm not happy with less than 30.

The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

Thirty million... if Cali wants peace.

Very good.

I also need to raise the w*r tax.

From now on, a million a month,

for both of you... and all our other partners.

Good move beating him, you son of a bitch.

If we get proof that Escobar is violating the terms of his surrender,

then they have to send him to a real prison,

but we need more than these aerial shots.

Can you get us satellite communications or wire intercepts?

There's a no-fly zone over the prison, with antiaircraft g*n

manned by the Colombian army to enforce it.

You're playing with f*re if Noonan finds out.

We don't got shit on him without intercepts.

- Don't need 'em. - What? The hell we don't.

They're not using phones.

- The hell is that? - I could spot a coop a mile away.

That's how they're sending messages.

To avoid our high-tech spy planes,

Pablo chose the most low-tech form of communication.

Never said the guy wasn't crafty.

- You see anything yet? - No, man.

You're blind as a bat. Give me those.

- Oh, one's goin'.

- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low. - I got it.

- You got it? - Yeah.

Low.

Ah...

That's a fast f*cking pigeon.

Give me the g*n.

- You trying to say I'm a lousy sh*t? - Yes, I am saying you're a lousy sh*t.

Here.

You're a shit sh*t.

- Heads up, heads up. - I got it.

- One o'clock. - I got it.

sh**t.

sh**t!

Ever been duck huntin'?

No, I have not been duck hunting, you... f*cking hillbilly.

- Bingo.

It's in Spanish. Read it.

""Delivery due with El Paisa in the tunnel.""

The son of a bitch built a tunnel under the jail.

We talked with Pablo and reached an agreement.

- Mm-hm? - Mm-hm.

We agreed to...

- one million dollars. - What?

Right.

What about the house in Cartagena?

That's not happening, right?

Do you want your house in Cartagena?

- Of course. - OK... you will have it.

Don't you see things are improving?

No, I see things are getting more complicated.

Instead of getting better... things are getting worse.

Mm-hm.

Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

Now, what about this w*r tax he's charging you?

$250,000 was a lot of money.

And now a million? Ridiculous.

What do you think I should do? Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

- Obviously not. - Then I don't understand.

- What do you want me to do? - It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

Look, I... adore Pablo. I adore him.

But the thing is, I don't know what's going on with him these days.

I don't know. Maybe he's depressed.

We're here in a Jacuzzi...

free.

- Do you love me? - Oh...

Stop f*cking around. You make me angry.

Against orders, we did high-altitude flyovers of the prison

- with our infrared cameras. - No tunnels.

Tomography report indicates nothing. Seismic measuring, nada.

Can we measure radio frequency energy?

Well, we could try. Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.

If he's bringing shit into this tunnel, you can bet he's going out that way.

If there's a tunnel there, he must have dug it to China.

Good luck.

Maybe we can...

We can ask the military to do light detection and ranging.

We got a better chance of Noonan authorizing a divining rod.

- All right, man, I'm calling it a night. - Nah, finish up.

No, you can't even smoke in here.

No luck?

These aerials don't indicate a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.

Hm.

Well, the only thing I can see in all of them is this truck.

- Are you finished with that, honey? - Yeah.

What happened?

Did it stop?

Good morning.

- What's up? - Are you ""The Paisa""?

- Yes. - Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

Do me a favor and get out of the truck.

- What's going on? - Don't be afraid.

Up against the truck.

Let's go.

Do me another favor.

Open it up.

Go on.

We missed a very important delivery.

Sex toys, back issues of Hustler, a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.

He's bored shitless in there.

Look, gringos... you don't have the right to do this.

Of course we have the right.

You just press the button in the truck and we will do the rest, OK?

If the boss finds out that I let you put cameras in the truck, he'll k*ll me.

What did he say?

He says if Pablo finds out, he'll k*ll him.

Amigo...

Pablo's your boss?

Yeah? Yeah.

I am your boss. Yes?

It's OK, it's OK! I'll do whatever you say.

Yeah?

Are you OK, friend?

Good day.

So what is this? What am I looking at exactly?

- Club Medellín. - This was all shipped in to La Catedral.

We got some big-screen TVs, nice stereo equipment.

That's a roulette wheel, a little bit of liquor.

Glad to see the judges could come down with the official from the airport.

Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.

Don't forget the jukebox with the hookers.

Of course, the lobster.

- This is a-- - Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

He has a casino right there at La Catedral.

- Where did you get these pictures? - From the DEA.

Of course.

It's not just these pictures.

They also have pictures of judges, local government people,

other narcos, prost*tute... Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

- Who else has seen these? - No one, as far as I know.

- That's why we have to act now.

Do you think the DEA is capable of leaking the photos to the media?

The DEA is capable of anything. That's why we have to do something now.

At one time, Escobar... used to own all of Colombia.

Now he's just the owner of his own prison.

If I had to choose between prost*tute at La Catedral...

or b*mb in the country...

I would be eternally grateful to these women.

Happy birthday, Pablo!

- Watch your step. - Careful with the little girl!

How are you? Welcome.

- Happy birthday. - Hello, sweetheart.

They're the ones I hired? I don't believe you.

They are really good, Blackie. I like them.

Come on, Pablo, tell us... what are you doing these days? Hm!

- How do you spend your time? - Aside from missing his family?

Oh! Of course.

- He's writing a book. - Mm!

- Mother. - What?

Isn't it true? You are writing a book.

Please, Mom.

Well, then, you tell them.

- It's a collection of magazine articles. - Many articles.

- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons. - Oh, cartoons!

From newspapers and magazines all over the world.

And you know what? People write him every day.

- It's because they love him. - I can imagine.

You have to find ways to keep your mind occupied around here.

Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband and Galeano to help you with the business.

Yes, on that note, Kiko is so grateful to you

for all the responsibilities you have given him.

Thank you very much.

- We were in Cartagena-- - Where?

- We were in Cartagena last week. - Oh, yeah?

Oh, yes, we spent some beautiful days there relaxing.

It must feel good to be able to relax like that.

- How nice. - Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

But I'll tell you, Cartagena is really expensive.

Oh, it's unaffordable.

Besides, this whole ""w*r with Cali"" thing,

it's tough, you know, with the tax we have to pay.

We understand it's not easy, but there's not much we can do.

It's OK.

Kiko complained about that?

He mentioned it.

He didn't complain, Pablo, he didn't complain.

Everyone here is absolutely aware of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

for God's sake. So I think it's normal, right?

It's normal that we'd give you our support.

Well, I think it's normal... I really do.

Juan Pablito, go play with your dad for a little while, OK?

Honey, you should play with the kids a little bit.

Leave the gift here.

I'll look after it.

The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.

Carrillo was right. He won.

What are those?

These are a list of, uh... my accomplishments.

You shred these.

Apologize!

Apologize!

Apologize!

- Were you watching? - Yes.

You apologize!

I'm sorry, boss.

I didn't mean it.

- Relax. - Are you all right, boss?

Relax. That's how the game goes.

Go on, go on. You guys continue.

Are you all right, sir?

Boss.

Excuse me, boss, but I need to speak to you.

Everything OK?

- Boss, we have a problem. - What problem?

You remember that Moncada and Galeano had a large shipment

- that was seized in Boyacá? - Yes.

- 250 kilos. - Exactly.

Can you imagine, a farmer found three million dollars buried in a field?

Do you know where that was, boss?

In Rionegro.

True story. And pay attention, because it changes a lot of lives.

Remember how I told you that the cartel was making so much money

that they had to bury it?

And Blackbeard had the treasure map.

Well, after we got him, he gave a lot of it up...

but not all of it.

It just so happens that one day, out in a field in Rionegro,

a farmer who worked for Galeano and Moncada found one.

At first, the poor guy thought he'd dug up a body.

Over the years, plenty of 'em had been buried out in the fields.

The farmer knew right away it was narco money.

He was terrified he might get buried himself if he took it.

So he took the money to a guy who was connected,

who took it to another guy...

who took it to Pablo's sicario lieutenant... Velasco.

There's cash buried everywhere.

The guerillas, the paramilitary, the narcos...

- Everybody's burying cash. - Yes, I know.

But right on Moncada and Galeano's property?

Don't you think that's strange, boss?

I think it's strange.

Look. All this cash...

was found... in a field.

- That's good luck, Pablo.

Or it could be bad luck. For you both.

It was on your property, in Rionegro.

But Pablo, those lands are over 300 acres,

and most of us rent out to the farmers.

Mm.

You told me that you had a 250-kilo shipment seized.

That's true.

The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

Who told you to open your mouth?

Not true? Hm?

Pablo, do you think we're stealing from you?

That we made up that whole story about the seizure?

If you'd like, check with the cops in Boyacá.

Right, because cops in Boyacá are so honest, right?

Keep in mind that we bought that property from Gustavo.

I even remember Gustavo saying that you had cash stashed in every corner.

Gustavo... would never forget where he buried cash.

Who's putting this shit in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

These f*ck would sell their own mother.

- We are partners and friends. - Mm.

Maybe that cash was lost because I raised the tax?

Bullshit. I paid the tax and never complained.

That's a lie.

- Because you complained to your wife. - I haven't complained.

You have no idea what I talk about with Judy.

I understand this is difficult for you, Pablo--

What is difficult for me?

Well, managing all of this. That's why you hired us.

- So we can manage it and look after it. - Mm.

You trust us, right?

I understand this makes you anxious--

- Do I look anxious? - No, I didn't mean that.

- You said with certainty that-- - No, no, what I meant to say was--

- I think you're the one who's anxious. - We didn't do shit, Pablo!

With that tone of yours... you're telling me you didn't do shit?

Like I was some kind of idiot. Is this my cash or not?!

No, Pablo.

Did you take it and bury it in Rionegro or not?!

For sure, these guys hid your cash, boss.

- It's the truth, you pair of liars. - Of course, he--

- Shut up, f*ck! - You're petty thieves!

You shut up, f*ck! Don't you disrespect me!

Pablo, look at me, man.

We're family.

You're my daughter's godfather.

And also godfather to Galeano's kids.

What's going on?

We're like brothers.

We're partners and friends.

We've been in this our whole lives, Pablo.

We made our first trip to Miami together.

We made so much cash together that we don't even know what we spent it on.

What's the problem?

What's happening?

The two of us love you very much.

And we're very grateful.

All right.

Being stuck in here...

can make someone paranoid.

- Paisa! Paisa!

Well, man, these things happen, right?

We're here for whatever you need. Trust us.

I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

I'll bring you a few little things to keep you entertained, OK?

Don Pablo.

Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

You're a dog, you son of a bitch!

What does it feel like to take a shit on your own empire?

You want us to tell you that we stole the money?

At the end of the day, you'll believe whatever you want, f*ck.

Goodbye, Kiko.

k*ll me if you're such a man, f*ck.

k*ll me with your own f*cking hands!

Who are you talking to, assh*le?

f*ck!

Wait a second!

Be careful, man.

Look what the d*ad guy gave me.

What the f*ck! You're going to burn all the meat!

What is wrong with you? Can't you see I'm doing it to cover the smell?

- Yeah, but let's not burn it all. - What are we gonna do with all this meat?

- What are you going to do? - What am I supposed to do?

What?

Boss, are you OK?

Do you need anything, boss?

We're grilling some meat. Do you want some?

No. I'm not hungry.

Navegante.

Boss.

- Do you want me to wax it? - No, relax.

This one's my favorite. I enjoy it.

This is a beautiful car.

Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

It's a shame.

I warned them.

As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

Do you still have that DEA contact?

Javier Peña? Of course.

I want you to contact him and confirm the rumors.

They're just as interested in screwing Escobar as we are.

I haven't heard from him since yesterday.

I've called everyone. I'm so worried.

Pablo told me that they left La Catedral.

Just relax, sweetie.

Your husband is fine.

No. No, thank you.

Maybe... they had to go somewhere else urgently?

Or maybe they left without saying anything.

The way our men usually do.

Yes, but it's a little strange, don't you think?

Kiko was very clear that he had a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

He said he would be home later.

We're trying to have another baby. I think I told you that.

No? We're trying to have another baby, and the time is right,

so we had a very important date to keep.

Are you sure that Pablo told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

Are you telling me that my husband is a liar?

I want my husband back.

If Pablo told Tata that they left...

it's because they left.

Listen... Pablo is your kids' godfather.

He would never hurt them.

Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.

There are rumors that he k*ll Galeano and Moncada.

Where, in jail?

Yeah, yeah.

""In jail.""

That doesn't make any sense. They're partners.

Maybe there is not such thing as sense with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

Bullshit. Where'd you get it?

The relatives of the men he k*ll... are up in arms.

The poor fellows went in, but they never got out.

I want to ask you gentlemen a serious question now.

How bad do you want Escobar?

How far are you willing to go in this matter?

What are you proposing?

Well, we both have access to information that could benefit the other.

No.

No, we don't trade information.

- Just hold on a second. - No.

He's an informant, Javi.

Whatever you got cookin', it stinks. I don't want it.

Appreciate the tip. Let's go.

Your partner here...

may need some convincing now.

Moncada and Galeano going into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.

Every return from this day forward...

no Moncada, no Galeano.

Personally, we couldn't have cared less about a couple of d*ad narcos.

It meant more chaos and confusion in the Medellín cartel.

But we wanted Escobar out of that piece of shit excuse for a jail,

in a real prison, not a fortress...

where his enemies could get payback.

You sure?

We can either play politics or we can do the job.

Well, we were never any good at playing politics anyway.

What do you think?

These photos are worth looking into.

And believe me, I'm going to.

If it's true, this is gonna cause a shit storm, you know?

- Be right back. - Gracias.

Well...

f*ck President Gaviria.

f*ck Noonan.

f*ck La Catedral.

And f*ck Pablo."

I'm gonna sh**t every f*cking hostage<br/>
<br/>
in the head. That's right.<br/>
<br/>
Who's doing this?<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo and Search Bloc,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure of it.<br/>
<br/>
- In the middle of our negotiations?<br/>
<br/>
- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...<br/>
<br/>
[a*t*matic g*n in distance]<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo panting]<br/>
<br/>
...or Carrillo doesn't give a shit<br/>
<br/>
about the negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
You know what we have to do, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
We have to close the deal fast...<br/>
<br/>
before they find us and k*ll us.<br/>
<br/>
Not before we build our own jail.<br/>
<br/>
And that f*cking p*ssy president<br/>
<br/>
will have to agree to that,<br/>
<br/>
even if I have to stick a b*mb up his ass.<br/>
<br/>
It's so f*cking cold.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a jacket there for me?<br/>
<br/>
- Check it out, f*g.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
<br/>
It's a miniskirt with your name on it.<br/>
<br/>
- ""Gustavo Gaviria.""<br/>
<br/>
- Give me that.<br/>
<br/>
[dialing satellite phone]<br/>
<br/>
All right, let's call the boys.<br/>
<br/>
And what about you?<br/>
<br/>
Are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
If Gaviria'd let us put US boots<br/>
<br/>
on the ground,<br/>
<br/>
we would've caught the son of a bitch<br/>
<br/>
in five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be too sure about that.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, shit.<br/>
<br/>
- [man on radio] Hold on, hold on!<br/>
<br/>
We picked up a signal in the woods<br/>
<br/>
surrounding the target area.<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
OK, boys, we're in the clear.<br/>
<br/>
Pick us up at El Mariano pass.<br/>
<br/>
- [man] We got new Escobar coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
- Smarter than he looks, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
[man] We have a tracking signal<br/>
<br/>
on the phone presumed to be Escobar's,<br/>
<br/>
five clicks from the finca.<br/>
<br/>
Request Colombian units to be sent ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Search Bloc,<br/>
<br/>
we are registering the latitude<br/>
<br/>
and longitude at a fixed point.<br/>
<br/>
The subject appears<br/>
<br/>
to have stopped moving.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
You've gotta be sh1tting me.<br/>
<br/>
[snorts]<br/>
<br/>
[Latin guitar theme music plays]<br/>
<br/>
- [Connie chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
- [door opens]<br/>
<br/>
- [babbling]<br/>
<br/>
- I know.<br/>
<br/>
[baby crying]<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] He got away.<br/>
<br/>
Again.<br/>
<br/>
- Shh.<br/>
<br/>
- You hear what I said?<br/>
<br/>
[Connie whispers] Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve.<br/>
<br/>
- I think she's got colic.<br/>
<br/>
- [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
What is that?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it means she can't sleep,<br/>
<br/>
which means neither can I.<br/>
<br/>
Did you call the orphanages?<br/>
<br/>
You think I could explain the situation<br/>
<br/>
in English, let alone Spanish?<br/>
<br/>
I still don't understand<br/>
<br/>
why you brought her back here.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's take her to a hospital.<br/>
<br/>
No, Steve, we can't just take her to<br/>
<br/>
a hospital. It's not like a puppy shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta<br/>
<br/>
figure out what we're gonna do with her.<br/>
<br/>
There's a w*r going on, Connie.<br/>
<br/>
You said it was only<br/>
<br/>
gonna be for a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
It's already been a week.<br/>
<br/>
What are we doing here?<br/>
<br/>
- Is that my t-shirt?<br/>
<br/>
- We're out of diapers.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you go get some more before<br/>
<br/>
she shits through your whole closet?<br/>
<br/>
[door opens]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] How nice to see<br/>
<br/>
that you have made friends.<br/>
<br/>
Careful, son.<br/>
<br/>
This woman is very clever.<br/>
<br/>
She can grab your g*n<br/>
<br/>
and sh**t you in the head.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies, boss.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
<br/>
As well as one might expect.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to record another tape for me.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
No, not until you free more hostages.<br/>
<br/>
Maruja is very ill.<br/>
<br/>
Ricardo has an ulcer.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the only one you need to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
Then why does the Colombian government<br/>
<br/>
keep trying to capture me?<br/>
<br/>
Look...<br/>
<br/>
I admire your bravery very much.<br/>
<br/>
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,<br/>
<br/>
with all due respect, so is your father.<br/>
<br/>
And what did you expect?<br/>
<br/>
To get into Congress<br/>
<br/>
like it was nothing?<br/>
<br/>
Without it mattering that you,<br/>
<br/>
in fact, traffic drugs?<br/>
<br/>
I expected respect.<br/>
<br/>
You had respect<br/>
<br/>
when you built homes for the poor.<br/>
<br/>
But when you didn't get that respect<br/>
<br/>
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,<br/>
<br/>
you threw a tantrum.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to do marvelous things<br/>
<br/>
for this country.<br/>
<br/>
If I have made myself into a monster,<br/>
<br/>
like all of you say,<br/>
<br/>
that is the fault of people<br/>
<br/>
like your father...<br/>
<br/>
and those politicians ""of always.""<br/>
<br/>
Those oligarchs and those people<br/>
<br/>
were never going to tolerate<br/>
<br/>
that little paisa from Medellín<br/>
<br/>
who had more money<br/>
<br/>
and was more intelligent than all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
You would have done marvelous things.<br/>
<br/>
And that is the saddest part.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Escobar has promised<br/>
<br/>
to free two more hostages.<br/>
<br/>
But in exchange, he has asked that you<br/>
<br/>
continue negotiations with transparency.<br/>
<br/>
President Gaviria...<br/>
<br/>
he knows what you are doing.<br/>
<br/>
He knows.<br/>
<br/>
If you insist on trying to capture him<br/>
<br/>
with the help of the Americans...<br/>
<br/>
they're going to k*ll us all.<br/>
<br/>
You are risking my daughter's life!<br/>
<br/>
No, Nydia, with all due respect,<br/>
<br/>
we are not risking anyone's life.<br/>
<br/>
Our priority is the life of your daughter<br/>
<br/>
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.<br/>
<br/>
But our priority<br/>
<br/>
is also to capture Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot have both things at once.<br/>
<br/>
Negotiate with Escobar<br/>
<br/>
while trying to capture him?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what he is demanding?<br/>
<br/>
That we call a constitutional referendum<br/>
<br/>
to abolish extradition.<br/>
<br/>
That he only plead guilty<br/>
<br/>
to having tr*ffick drugs one time.<br/>
<br/>
And worst of all,<br/>
<br/>
he wants to build his own jail<br/>
<br/>
and have his own guards<br/>
<br/>
to watch over him.<br/>
<br/>
This is a deal with the devil.<br/>
<br/>
You are the president of a country<br/>
<br/>
that became a living hell some time ago.<br/>
<br/>
With whom else did you expect<br/>
<br/>
to be making a deal?<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Gaviria could easier<br/>
<br/>
cut a hundred deals with the devil<br/>
<br/>
before he could cut one with Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Bowing to Pablo's demands<br/>
<br/>
was political su1c1de.<br/>
<br/>
So, he did what politicians do best:<br/>
<br/>
he stalled.<br/>
<br/>
He kept our planes in the air<br/>
<br/>
and prayed to God that we got a hit.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Hello. It's Gorilla.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] Ground units,<br/>
<br/>
begin trilateration for signal origin.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] And when we did, it was<br/>
<br/>
not the hit that we were hoping for.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me, Gorilla, I don't feel well.<br/>
<br/>
Miss Diana...<br/>
<br/>
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?<br/>
<br/>
You are loyal like a sheep,<br/>
<br/>
aren't you?<br/>
<br/>
That man is your kidnapper... and mine,<br/>
<br/>
and that of the whole nation.<br/>
<br/>
Here, you go first.<br/>
<br/>
- [a*t*matic g*n]<br/>
<br/>
- [indistinct shouts in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
[men shouting]<br/>
<br/>
Hide in here, quickly!<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Who would've thought a failed raid<br/>
<br/>
would result in Escobar's biggest victory?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo didn't even have<br/>
<br/>
to pull the trigger. We did it for him.<br/>
<br/>
[Carrillo in English]<br/>
<br/>
Guys, we have a problem.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] For the battle-fatigued<br/>
<br/>
citizens of Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
Diana's death was the final straw.<br/>
<br/>
This wasn't just an oligarch dying.<br/>
<br/>
Her presence on the nation's TV screens<br/>
<br/>
and in their homes transcended class.<br/>
<br/>
The people were devastated.<br/>
<br/>
For President Gaviria,<br/>
<br/>
there was little room left to move.<br/>
<br/>
[speaks indistinctly in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
[Nydia] Mr. President!<br/>
<br/>
You k*ll my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Let her pass.<br/>
<br/>
Wait...<br/>
<br/>
If you had accepted his terms,<br/>
<br/>
my daughter would still be alive!<br/>
<br/>
Give him whatever he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Don't let others go through the suffering<br/>
<br/>
we've had to endure.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President... we need to leave.<br/>
<br/>
God be with you, Nydia.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
There's something<br/>
<br/>
I want to make very clear.<br/>
<br/>
You are not to blame for Diana's death.<br/>
<br/>
OK? That has to be clear.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar has the resources<br/>
<br/>
for this to go on forever.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and so do we.<br/>
<br/>
We are the state.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to fight, do whatever we have<br/>
<br/>
to do, and we are going to finish him.<br/>
<br/>
We have options.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, why don't we allow<br/>
<br/>
the American military to come in?<br/>
<br/>
I know-- We don't like it.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't like it.<br/>
<br/>
But if it's a specific, clear mission--<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
- Something covert.<br/>
<br/>
No!<br/>
<br/>
It's time to end all of this.<br/>
<br/>
Give Escobar what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
[Eduardo] Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
[Javier in English] If your Congress<br/>
<br/>
abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.<br/>
<br/>
- We're a paper f*cking tiger!<br/>
<br/>
- Everything we have done is lost.<br/>
<br/>
[Eduardo] We have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
The people, the public... it's tired<br/>
<br/>
of all these b*mb and bloodshed!<br/>
<br/>
Right, and business goes as usual,<br/>
<br/>
- he just runs it from that jail.<br/>
<br/>
- Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
All things considered,<br/>
<br/>
it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.<br/>
<br/>
For public relations?<br/>
<br/>
It's capitulation.<br/>
<br/>
You want Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Because you want to parade him<br/>
<br/>
in your DEA jackets?<br/>
<br/>
You think this is a game, right?<br/>
<br/>
This is Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
and our people want peace!<br/>
<br/>
This is not a f*cking game!<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Well...<br/>
<br/>
at this time, our friend, Fernando,<br/>
<br/>
is going to tell us a little something.<br/>
<br/>
[clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
The Colombian government is going<br/>
<br/>
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,<br/>
<br/>
accepting only one simple charge:<br/>
<br/>
drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
And...<br/>
<br/>
they are going to let him build a jail<br/>
<br/>
which the police<br/>
<br/>
cannot be within three kilometers of.<br/>
<br/>
At last...<br/>
<br/>
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!<br/>
<br/>
- Long live Colombia, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- ¡Viva!<br/>
<br/>
- Fernando...<br/>
<br/>
- Mm?<br/>
<br/>
- ...thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
- No problem, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
And do you know when Congress<br/>
<br/>
is going to vote to abolish extradition?<br/>
<br/>
Mm! Yes, it's--<br/>
<br/>
It's a matter of... of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
And at that time, you will be able<br/>
<br/>
to turn yourself over to the authorities.<br/>
<br/>
It pleases me very much to finish my work<br/>
<br/>
with you with such a great victory.<br/>
<br/>
No, brother. Now is when I am<br/>
<br/>
going to need your services the most.<br/>
<br/>
- How-- How's that?<br/>
<br/>
- Fernando...<br/>
<br/>
now it's time for us to find legal means<br/>
<br/>
to reduce my sentence even more.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
And what does this mean for us, huh?<br/>
<br/>
It means, my love...<br/>
<br/>
that now I have a jail.<br/>
<br/>
And for you,<br/>
<br/>
visiting days will be...<br/>
<br/>
- every day.<br/>
<br/>
- [laughs]<br/>
<br/>
- I'm serious, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- So am I.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
The problem, Pablo, is that...<br/>
<br/>
now that you have admitted<br/>
<br/>
to tr*ffick in narcotics,<br/>
<br/>
my image as a journalist<br/>
<br/>
cannot be associated with yours.<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo] Hm.<br/>
<br/>
So then...<br/>
<br/>
now you think I am going to damage your<br/>
<br/>
credibility as a journalist... is that it?<br/>
<br/>
You understand what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.<br/>
<br/>
I think that... it's time for me<br/>
<br/>
to set you free, so that...<br/>
<br/>
you can find a boyfriend who's honest...<br/>
<br/>
so that you can get a little house,<br/>
<br/>
have little kids,<br/>
<br/>
- little dogs...<br/>
<br/>
- Don't joke around, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm not joking.<br/>
<br/>
[softly] I just want you to know...<br/>
<br/>
that you, Valeria...<br/>
<br/>
are a bandit, just like me.<br/>
<br/>
So don't come to me with bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you got away with it,<br/>
<br/>
eh, assh*le?<br/>
<br/>
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Geniuses...<br/>
<br/>
are always branded as crazy.<br/>
<br/>
- Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
- The Ochoas...<br/>
<br/>
- The Ochoas what?<br/>
<br/>
You can bet<br/>
<br/>
they're going to be pissed off.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the treaty?<br/>
<br/>
Or because you're f*cking their sister?<br/>
<br/>
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope they don't<br/>
<br/>
charge you for it later.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] The race was on.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo needed to build his jail<br/>
<br/>
as fast as possible.<br/>
<br/>
As for his enemies, they needed<br/>
<br/>
to get to him before that happened.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he walked inside,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo would be safe.<br/>
<br/>
And everyone on the outside wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
[in English] We got an official cease<br/>
<br/>
and desist order for any further operation<br/>
<br/>
when Pablo officially surrenders.<br/>
<br/>
- Search Bloc is gonna be disbanded.<br/>
<br/>
- [Javier] We heard the terms.<br/>
<br/>
- No cops within two miles of the prison.<br/>
<br/>
- This is a f*cking sham.<br/>
<br/>
It's a death warrant for my men.<br/>
<br/>
I won't be able to protect them.<br/>
<br/>
I won't let that happen.<br/>
<br/>
There are cops that hate Escobar<br/>
<br/>
just as much as I do.<br/>
<br/>
More.<br/>
<br/>
They're not gonna stop<br/>
<br/>
just because they're told to.<br/>
<br/>
You talking about vigilantes?<br/>
<br/>
Call it what you like... but I'm still<br/>
<br/>
gonna need those intel reports.<br/>
<br/>
- We'll get you anything we find.<br/>
<br/>
- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.<br/>
<br/>
They know we've been helping.<br/>
<br/>
One more and we're out.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you said you were all in.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
The soccer field will be over here.<br/>
<br/>
Here, I want to have<br/>
<br/>
a little doll house for Manuela,<br/>
<br/>
and downstairs,<br/>
<br/>
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.<br/>
<br/>
My family will live in a house<br/>
<br/>
down the hill.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to install a telescope<br/>
<br/>
so I can look at them whenever I want.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, right. More like<br/>
<br/>
you can look at other girls' asses.<br/>
<br/>
No. The family, the family.<br/>
<br/>
To see my kids.<br/>
<br/>
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
- Well...<br/>
<br/>
while we're in prison,<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo and me,<br/>
<br/>
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,<br/>
<br/>
Galeano, to oversee operations.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
We're privileged to be given<br/>
<br/>
that responsibility. You can count on us.<br/>
<br/>
We've already spoken about the operational<br/>
<br/>
plan and everything's clear, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell them about the tax?<br/>
<br/>
- No, I didn't.<br/>
<br/>
- The tax?<br/>
<br/>
What tax is this?<br/>
<br/>
Who paid for the w*r we fought?<br/>
<br/>
You.<br/>
<br/>
- You, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- That's right.<br/>
<br/>
We have peace now.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to directly<br/>
<br/>
benefit from that.<br/>
<br/>
It's only fair that you contribute<br/>
<br/>
to the legal and security costs<br/>
<br/>
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.<br/>
<br/>
And about how much will that be?<br/>
<br/>
We agreed to what,<br/>
<br/>
$200,000 a month, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, 200 grand.<br/>
<br/>
200 grand?<br/>
<br/>
That's a lot of money, brother.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
But consider it done.<br/>
<br/>
And again... thank you<br/>
<br/>
very much for this responsibility,<br/>
<br/>
- and for considering us.<br/>
<br/>
- All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
- Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Why should I let them<br/>
<br/>
reap the fruits of our labor<br/>
<br/>
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
But right now, we really<br/>
<br/>
need those two f*g to be loyal.<br/>
<br/>
And what?<br/>
<br/>
You don't think I inspire loyalty?<br/>
<br/>
My loyalty?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you know you have it.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.<br/>
<br/>
You know, the thing is, Pablo...<br/>
<br/>
you won.<br/>
<br/>
There's no arguing that.<br/>
<br/>
But you gave in.<br/>
<br/>
And there are people<br/>
<br/>
who will see that as weakness.<br/>
<br/>
We've gotta keep our enemies close,<br/>
<br/>
now more than ever.<br/>
<br/>
- [waiter murmurs in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
- [Valeria] Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
It's great to see you again, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very happy to see you.<br/>
<br/>
Although, I must say...<br/>
<br/>
it was a little unexpected.<br/>
<br/>
We are worried about you.<br/>
<br/>
And... why are ""we"" worried?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's cutting a deal<br/>
<br/>
with the government.<br/>
<br/>
He's going to have<br/>
<br/>
to admit to certain things.<br/>
<br/>
Things that may damage<br/>
<br/>
your reputation by association.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm good at anything,<br/>
<br/>
it's protecting my reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, this time it's different.<br/>
<br/>
Look... you helped create<br/>
<br/>
that ""Robin Hood Paisa"" bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have<br/>
<br/>
to take responsibility for that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he tricked me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Like the rest of the world.<br/>
<br/>
You have enemies, see?<br/>
<br/>
They're not gonna<br/>
<br/>
let you get away with it.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Valeria...<br/>
<br/>
we have a lot of connections in New York,<br/>
<br/>
a strong presence, you could say.<br/>
<br/>
You should go there,<br/>
<br/>
at least for a little while.<br/>
<br/>
And leave Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
There are a million Colombians there.<br/>
<br/>
A new audience.<br/>
<br/>
And they don't care if you shared your bed<br/>
<br/>
with a monster or not.<br/>
<br/>
- [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
- Just for a while.<br/>
<br/>
When this is all over, you'll be able to<br/>
<br/>
come back here with your head held high,<br/>
<br/>
I guarantee it.<br/>
<br/>
And not only that, you'll have earned<br/>
<br/>
a brand-new audience in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
- Betrayal is not my style.<br/>
<br/>
- What betrayal?<br/>
<br/>
And what would you be betraying?<br/>
<br/>
Your role as his mistress?<br/>
<br/>
You remain loyal to a man who has never<br/>
<br/>
thought you good enough to be his wife.<br/>
<br/>
His wife? Me?<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no,<br/>
<br/>
you're very much mistaken, my dear.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing I want<br/>
<br/>
is to be married to him.<br/>
<br/>
Besides...<br/>
<br/>
do you think I'd want to be his wife?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I want to be locked up,<br/>
<br/>
waiting all day at the Monaco building,<br/>
<br/>
while he's out with...<br/>
<br/>
with me?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
That's too boring.<br/>
<br/>
- [Tata moans]<br/>
<br/>
- [Pablo grunting]<br/>
<br/>
I missed you so much.<br/>
<br/>
I missed you, too.<br/>
<br/>
- [Pablo grunts]<br/>
<br/>
- [moaning]<br/>
<br/>
No, it was terrible.<br/>
<br/>
It was terrible.<br/>
<br/>
Every day in a different house...<br/>
<br/>
worried about you...<br/>
<br/>
the kids...<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
The truth is...<br/>
<br/>
it's very good to be home.<br/>
<br/>
- You look happy.<br/>
<br/>
- Of course.<br/>
<br/>
[soft chuckle]<br/>
<br/>
That time has passed.<br/>
<br/>
It's the happiest face I've ever seen<br/>
<br/>
on a man about to go to jail.<br/>
<br/>
[expl*si*n]<br/>
<br/>
- [shouting outside]<br/>
<br/>
- [alarm blaring]<br/>
<br/>
The kids!<br/>
<br/>
[screams] The kids, Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
- The kids!<br/>
<br/>
- No, Tata!<br/>
<br/>
- I have to go to them!<br/>
<br/>
- Stay here!<br/>
<br/>
- [sobbing] My children!<br/>
<br/>
- Stay here!<br/>
<br/>
I'll go get them. Stay here.<br/>
<br/>
- [Tata sobs]<br/>
<br/>
- [alarm continues]<br/>
<br/>
- Juan Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
- [Manuela crying]<br/>
<br/>
Juan Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
- Are you OK?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Go to your mother.<br/>
<br/>
Go to your mother.<br/>

<br/>
[Steve] The expl*si*n was<br/>
<br/>
from a car b*mb on the street below,<br/>
<br/>
about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.<br/>
<br/>
It made little Manuela<br/>

forever deaf in one ear.<br/>

<br/>
the innocent always seemed<br/>
<br/>
to be the ones who got hurt.<br/>
<br/>
For Escobar, the Monaco b*mb<br/>
<br/>
told him two things:<br/>
<br/>
First, it showed him that the cops<br/>
<br/>
weren't his biggest problem.<br/>
<br/>
They would never use a b*mb.<br/>
<br/>
This was a new player, one that<br/>
<br/>
wasn't above going after his family.<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Don't worry, cousin.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to k*ll them all.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Second, and the one<br/>
<br/>
that f*cked with his head the most...<br/>
<br/>
was that for the first time in his life...<br/>
<br/>
someone had given him up.<br/>
<br/>
And worse yet,<br/>
<br/>
he had no idea who.<br/>
<br/>
[phone ringing]<br/>
<br/>
[in Spanish] Hello?<br/>
<br/>
[man] Valeria, there was an attempted hit<br/>
<br/>
at the Monaco building.<br/>
<br/>
- Just now?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car b*mb.<br/>
<br/>
- Who was inside?<br/>
<br/>
- We don't know.<br/>
<br/>
[stammers]<br/>
<br/>
What other information do you have?<br/>
<br/>
That's all the information<br/>
<br/>
we have right now.<br/>
<br/>
OK, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
[Fabio]<br/>
<br/>
He always takes her to the same motel.<br/>
<br/>
[approaching footsteps]<br/>
<br/>
- Marina.<br/>
<br/>
- Where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to the city.<br/>
<br/>
I have to get out of this prison.<br/>
<br/>
- Come here, Marina.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Have a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Be safe.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
You know what he's going to do, right?<br/>
<br/>
He's going to continue conducting<br/>
<br/>
his business behind those walls<br/>
<br/>
that are protected<br/>
<br/>
by the Colombian government.<br/>
<br/>
We should give him credit.<br/>
<br/>
The man is a genius.<br/>
<br/>
Well... all the more reason<br/>
<br/>
that we should negotiate our surrender.<br/>
<br/>
But you know that Pablo<br/>
<br/>
took it upon himself to close that door.<br/>
<br/>
So we need to take advantage<br/>
<br/>
of your political contacts,<br/>
<br/>
especially General Jaramillo.<br/>
<br/>
Can you talk to him for us?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't think it will be enough.<br/>
<br/>
[Jorge]<br/>
<br/>
What are you saying?<br/>
<br/>
That you're going<br/>
<br/>
to have to offer something more,<br/>
<br/>
something that interests them enough<br/>
<br/>
to make a deal with you.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
He is the key to Pablo's business.<br/>
<br/>
If that son of a bitch goes down,<br/>
<br/>
the whole empire goes down.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, that could work.<br/>
<br/>
That could work.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] It is often said<br/>
<br/>
there is no honor among thieves.<br/>
<br/>
That's doubly true of drug dealers.<br/>
<br/>
The Ochoas, with the help of Cali,<br/>
<br/>
made their own surrender deal.<br/>
<br/>
No extradition, no stiff sentence.<br/>
<br/>
The Colombian government<br/>
<br/>
was willing to overlook their part<br/>
<br/>
in the largest cocaine empire<br/>
<br/>
on the face of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, they would<br/>
<br/>
serve reduced sentences.<br/>
<br/>
- The charge?<br/>
<br/>
- [in Spanish] Follow me.<br/>
<br/>
Illegally importing bulls from Spain.<br/>
<br/>
I shit you not.<br/>
<br/>
They went to jail<br/>
<br/>
with smiles on their faces,<br/>
<br/>
'cause all they had to do<br/>
<br/>
was use their sister as bait<br/>
<br/>
to catch a fish the cops actually wanted.<br/>
<br/>
[Marina in Spanish] Kiss me.<br/>
<br/>
- You look pretty, baby.<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah, sure.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is<br/>
<br/>
you've always looked pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
[Marina] What's happening?<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo] Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is happening here.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?<br/>
<br/>
That's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
- Say goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
- [Marina] No.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo, look at me. Gustav--<br/>
<br/>
Does your family know where you are?<br/>
<br/>
- Gustavo!<br/>
<br/>
- Calm down, Marina.<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo]<br/>
<br/>
You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
We're already in negotiations<br/>
<br/>
with the government.<br/>
<br/>
- You have no reason to be doing this.<br/>
<br/>
- You're right.<br/>
<br/>
That's why I'm not here.<br/>
<br/>
Then what the f*ck do you want?<br/>
<br/>
Don't act stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Give me your cousin...<br/>
<br/>
and I'll let you live.<br/>
<br/>
[sighs]<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll me, then, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
I won't do that myself.<br/>
<br/>
But I want to introduce you to some people<br/>
<br/>
who would love to do it for me.<br/>
<br/>
This guy? This is Lastia.<br/>
<br/>
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá<br/>
<br/>
in a b*mb you coordinated.<br/>
<br/>
She was 17 years old.<br/>
<br/>
And this guy here...<br/>
<br/>
this is Trujillo.<br/>
<br/>
You k*ll his father<br/>
<br/>
and his brother for being cops.<br/>
<br/>
- That has nothing to do with me.<br/>
<br/>
- No?<br/>
<br/>
You know...<br/>
<br/>
if you support evil, you are evil.<br/>
<br/>
Look at them.<br/>
<br/>
I just want you to look at their faces.<br/>
<br/>
A few of the victims<br/>
<br/>
you've left in your wake.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me...<br/>
<br/>
have you ever felt<br/>
<br/>
the swift vengeance of justice?<br/>
<br/>
Give me your cousin...<br/>
<br/>
or I'll let these men<br/>
<br/>
show you that vengeance with their fists.<br/>
<br/>
Do it, then...<br/>
<br/>
you sons of bitches.<br/>
<br/>
OK, then.<br/>
<br/>
We'll see how you feel...<br/>
<br/>
after ten minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Do it.<br/>
<br/>
[grunts]<br/>
<br/>
- [heavy punches landing]<br/>
<br/>
- [Gustavo grunts, groans]<br/>
<br/>
[shaky exhale]<br/>
<br/>
[wheezing]<br/>
<br/>
Tell me where your cousin is.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't have to end like this.<br/>
<br/>
[sputters]<br/>
<br/>
[coughing]<br/>
<br/>
Tell me where your cousin is.<br/>
<br/>
[panting]<br/>
<br/>
We...<br/>
<br/>
are bandits...<br/>
<br/>
not snitches, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo laughs]<br/>
<br/>
[shouts] You're--<br/>
<br/>
You're all gonna die, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
You're all d*ad, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
You're all d*ad, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
You, your families,<br/>
<br/>
your wives are all d*ad, f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
You're all d*ad!<br/>
<br/>
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel, they're going<br/>
<br/>
to make us pay for this.<br/>
<br/>
Report his death as a result<br/>
<br/>
of a sh**t-out with the police.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you report that he fired first.<br/>
<br/>
But Colonel, he's all b*at up.<br/>
<br/>
That work for you?<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing... more beautiful<br/>
<br/>
and more important in my life than this.<br/>
<br/>
We're all here together... united.<br/>
<br/>
Now let's eat and enjoy<br/>
<br/>
this marvelous food.<br/>
<br/>
- Wait, wait.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, yeah, the beets.<br/>
<br/>
- Tata?<br/>
<br/>
- Boss?<br/>
<br/>
Hello, son. Have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
- Sit down--<br/>
<br/>
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me like a man.<br/>
<br/>
- Gustavo is d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
- What?<br/>
<br/>
They found his body on the outskirts<br/>
<br/>
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.<br/>
<br/>
[Hermilda] How's that?<br/>
<br/>
They also sh*t him, boss.<br/>
<br/>
No, no!<br/>
<br/>
How dare you come to my house saying that!<br/>
<br/>
How dare you!<br/>
<br/>
Leave! Get out of my house!<br/>
<br/>
You... you are leaving right now!<br/>
<br/>
Get out of my house! Go on!<br/>
<br/>
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...<br/>
<br/>
Go on! Get out of here!<br/>
<br/>
[whispers] It's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Everything's going to be fine.<br/>
<br/>
[sobbing]<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure about this?<br/>
<br/>
[softly] Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to take him<br/>
<br/>
to the funeral home...<br/>
<br/>
and guard his body the entire time<br/>
<br/>
until it's buried.<br/>
<br/>
- All right.<br/>
<br/>
- Go on.<br/>
<br/>
[door opens]<br/>
<br/>
How are you doing, son?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.<br/>
<br/>
When...<br/>
<br/>
you were nine... or ten...<br/>
<br/>
do you remember?<br/>
<br/>
How you would<br/>
<br/>
ride around on your bicycles.<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
You'd go up into the mountains<br/>
<br/>
and just disappear.<br/>
<br/>
The whole day would go by...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my.<br/>
<br/>
And we would call you...<br/>
<br/>
We seemed crazy,<br/>
<br/>
yelling for you all over the place...<br/>
<br/>
until finally you would appear.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God.<br/>
<br/>
""Where were you?""<br/>
<br/>
""Where have you been, son?""<br/>
<br/>
I would yell out.<br/>
<br/>
""In the mountains, Mama.""<br/>
<br/>
""Higher than the clouds, Auntie,""<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo would say, laughing.<br/>
<br/>
He...<br/>
<br/>
He always wanted to go farther.<br/>
<br/>
He always did.<br/>
<br/>
- But with you.<br/>
<br/>
- [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Only with you.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think it would end this way.<br/>
<br/>
[breath trembling]<br/>
<br/>
Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
[low murmurs]<br/>
<br/>
Boss? Someone came<br/>
<br/>
all the way out here to see you.<br/>
<br/>
Miss Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
What's she doing here?<br/>
<br/>
I'm here only because<br/>
<br/>
I have important information.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it's very important.<br/>
<br/>
It's about Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us, then.<br/>
<br/>
I've been told the Ochoa brothers<br/>
<br/>
have been seen in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
They are the ones<br/>
<br/>
who turned Gustavo over,<br/>
<br/>
in exchange for the cartel helping them<br/>
<br/>
seal a deal with the government.<br/>
<br/>
How do you know that?<br/>
<br/>
You know me, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I have my ways.<br/>
<br/>
Who in Cali?<br/>
<br/>
Pacho Herrera.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve]<br/>
<br/>
Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,<br/>
<br/>
so he ordered his sicarios<br/>
<br/>
to hit them during a soccer match.<br/>
<br/>
- It was very effective.<br/>
<br/>
- [overlapping g*n]<br/>
<br/>
He did get 14 Cali men that day.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was, everyone on<br/>
<br/>
the soccer field was dressed the same.<br/>
<br/>
[men grunting]<br/>
<br/>
- [g*n clicking]<br/>
<br/>
- By the time the sicarios spotted Pacho,<br/>
<br/>
he was already running away.<br/>
<br/>
[somber Latin song playing]<br/>
<br/>
[priest in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
""Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?<br/>
<br/>
Will your wrath burn like f*re?<br/>
<br/>
Remember how fleeting is my life,<br/>
<br/>
for what futility<br/>
<br/>
you have created the children of men.""<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Pablo had Gustavo<br/>
<br/>
buried in the hills of Medellín,<br/>
<br/>
- where the cousins had played as kids.<br/>
<br/>
- [sniffling]<br/>
<br/>
In his mind,<br/>
<br/>
losing his best friend<br/>
<br/>
was a price he had to pay<br/>
<br/>
to defeat extradition.<br/>
<br/>
So he ordered the burial<br/>
<br/>
to take place at the exact same time<br/>
<br/>
- that Congress was voting to repeal it.<br/>
<br/>
- [inaudible dialogue]<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was Gaviria's support,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's ""plata or plomo,""<br/>
<br/>
or maybe people<br/>
<br/>
were just sick of the v*olence...<br/>
<br/>
extradition was defeated by a landslide.<br/>
<br/>
Hours after the vote,<br/>
<br/>
a military helicopter<br/>
<br/>
was dispatched to coordinates<br/>
<br/>
just outside Medellín,<br/>
<br/>
where Pablo was waiting.<br/>
<br/>
[Eduardo in Spanish] As you know,<br/>
<br/>
I come on behalf of President Gaviria<br/>
<br/>
and the Colombian government.<br/>
<br/>
This is the offer of our terms<br/>
<br/>
for your surrender.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Peña and I<br/>
<br/>
had to go see it with our own eyes.<br/>
<br/>
A t*rror1st, a drug dealer and a m*rder<br/>
<br/>
surrendering to a grateful nation<br/>
<br/>
who gave him everything he asked for.<br/>
<br/>
It was the closest we'd ever come to him,<br/>
<br/>
and we never felt further away.<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo in Spanish] All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
Let me hand over my g*n.<br/>
<br/>
- You won.<br/>
<br/>
- We both did.<br/>
<br/>
Now Gaviria can announce<br/>
<br/>
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.<br/>
<br/>
Except that's not so true.<br/>
<br/>
You and I know it's a big lie.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Lies are necessary... when the truth<br/>
<br/>
is too difficult to believe. Right?<br/>
<br/>
[Steve]<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't a f*cking surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.<br/>
<br/>
He was escaping it.<br/>
<br/>
And all anyone could do was watch.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Escobar had used v*olence<br/>
<br/>
to bend the world to his will.<br/>
<br/>
They called it ""la gran mentira,""<br/>
<br/>
""the big lie.""<br/>
<br/>
And it was a lie.<br/>
<br/>
Except as I watched him<br/>
<br/>
fly away to his luxury prison...<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't help but think<br/>
<br/>
there was some truth in it.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve mutters] Damn it. f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
A truth that I hadn't<br/>
<br/>
been willing to accept.<br/>
<br/>
He'd b*at us because<br/>
<br/>
he was willing to do what we weren't.<br/>
<br/>
Bad guys don't play by the rules.<br/>
<br/>
That's what makes 'em bad.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that's what lets 'em win.<br/>
<br/>
[Poison in Spanish] Lagarto,<br/>
<br/>
are we gonna party tonight or what?<br/>
<br/>
[in English] I got Poison at 400<br/>
<br/>
to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
La Dispensaria.<br/>
<br/>
So who do we give this to? DEA?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.<br/>
<br/>
- Peña's an assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.<br/>
<br/>
- Sure.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] I made a promise to myself<br/>
<br/>
that when the time came<br/>
<br/>
that I could strike a blow<br/>
<br/>
against Escobar,<br/>
<br/>
even if it meant breaking the rules,<br/>
<br/>
oh, I was gonna do it.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello?<br/>
<br/>
- [man] Hey, Central Spike here.<br/>
<br/>
[Carrillo in Spanish] All right.<br/>
<br/>
[up-tempo Latin music playing]<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] You wanna tell me a good guy<br/>
<br/>
wouldn't have pushed the buttons<br/>
<br/>
on these f*ck?<br/>
<br/>
You wanna call me a bad guy?<br/>
<br/>
- [overlapping g*n]<br/>
<br/>
- [screaming]<br/>
<br/>
Fine. But if you do, it just means<br/>
<br/>
that you haven't met enough bad guys yet<br/>
<br/>
to know the difference.<br/>
<br/>
There's one thing I've learned<br/>
<br/>
down here in Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
- good and bad are relative concepts.<br/>
<br/>
- [up-tempo Latin song plays]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Who they say is very brave ♪<br/>
<br/>
♪ I hacked him with my machete so bad<br/>

- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

[Gustavo] There's no respect.

I couldn't even grab the cigarettes.

I'm gonna sh**t every f*cking hostage

in the head. That's right.

Who's doing this?

Carrillo and Search Bloc,

I'm sure of it.

- In the middle of our negotiations?

- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...

[a*t*matic g*n in distance]

[Gustavo panting]

...or Carrillo doesn't give a shit

about the negotiations.

You know what we have to do, Pablo.

We have to close the deal fast...

before they find us and k*ll us.

Not before we build our own jail.

And that f*cking p*ssy president

will have to agree to that,

even if I have to stick a b*mb up his ass.

It's so f*cking cold.

Is there a jacket there for me?

- Check it out, f*g.

- What's up?

It's a miniskirt with your name on it.

- ""Gustavo Gaviria.""

- Give me that.

[dialing satellite phone]

All right, let's call the boys.

And what about you?

Are you all right?

If Gaviria'd let us put US boots

on the ground,

we would've caught the son of a bitch

in five minutes.

I wouldn't be too sure about that.

Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.

- Oh, shit.

- [man on radio] Hold on, hold on!

We picked up a signal in the woods

surrounding the target area.

[Pablo in Spanish]

OK, boys, we're in the clear.

Pick us up at El Mariano pass.

- [man] We got new Escobar coordinates.

- Smarter than he looks, huh?

Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet.

[chuckles]

[man] We have a tracking signal

on the phone presumed to be Escobar's,

five clicks from the finca.

Request Colombian units to be sent ASAP.

[in Spanish] Search Bloc,

we are registering the latitude

and longitude at a fixed point.

The subject appears

to have stopped moving.

[in Spanish]

You've gotta be sh1tting me.

[snorts]

[Latin guitar theme music plays]

- [Connie chuckles]

- [door opens]

- [babbling]

- I know.

[baby crying]

[Steve] He got away.

Again.

- Shh.

- You hear what I said?

[Connie whispers] Come on.

Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve.

- I think she's got colic.

- [sighs]

What is that?

Well, it means she can't sleep,

which means neither can I.

Did you call the orphanages?

You think I could explain the situation

in English, let alone Spanish?

I still don't understand

why you brought her back here.

Well, let's take her to a hospital.

No, Steve, we can't just take her to

a hospital. It's not like a puppy shelter.

Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta

figure out what we're gonna do with her.

There's a w*r going on, Connie.

You said it was only

gonna be for a couple of days.

It's already been a week.

What are we doing here?

- Is that my t-shirt?

- We're out of diapers.

Why don't you go get some more before

she shits through your whole closet?

[door opens]

[in Spanish] How nice to see

that you have made friends.

Careful, son.

This woman is very clever.

She can grab your g*n

and sh**t you in the head.

My apologies, boss.

[sighs]

How do you feel?

As well as one might expect.

I need you to record another tape for me.

No.

No, not until you free more hostages.

Maruja is very ill.

Ricardo has an ulcer.

I'm the only one you need to negotiate.

Then why does the Colombian government

keep trying to capture me?

Look...

I admire your bravery very much.

But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,

with all due respect, so is your father.

And what did you expect?

To get into Congress

like it was nothing?

Without it mattering that you,

in fact, traffic drugs?

I expected respect.

You had respect

when you built homes for the poor.

But when you didn't get that respect

from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

you threw a tantrum.

I was going to do marvelous things

for this country.

If I have made myself into a monster,

like all of you say,

that is the fault of people

like your father...

and those politicians ""of always.""

Those oligarchs and those people

were never going to tolerate

that little paisa from Medellín

who had more money

and was more intelligent than all of them.

Yes.

You would have done marvelous things.

And that is the saddest part.

Mr. Escobar has promised

to free two more hostages.

But in exchange, he has asked that you

continue negotiations with transparency.

President Gaviria...

he knows what you are doing.

He knows.

If you insist on trying to capture him

with the help of the Americans...

they're going to k*ll us all.

You are risking my daughter's life!

No, Nydia, with all due respect,

we are not risking anyone's life.

Our priority is the life of your daughter

and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

But our priority

is also to capture Escobar.

You cannot have both things at once.

Negotiate with Escobar

while trying to capture him?

Do you know what he is demanding?

That we call a constitutional referendum

to abolish extradition.

That he only plead guilty

to having tr*ffick drugs one time.

And worst of all,

he wants to build his own jail

and have his own guards

to watch over him.

This is a deal with the devil.

You are the president of a country

that became a living hell some time ago.

With whom else did you expect

to be making a deal?

[Steve] Gaviria could easier

cut a hundred deals with the devil

before he could cut one with Pablo.

Bowing to Pablo's demands

was political su1c1de.

So, he did what politicians do best:

he stalled.

He kept our planes in the air

and prayed to God that we got a hit.

[in Spanish] Hello. It's Gorilla.

[in English] Ground units,

begin trilateration for signal origin.

[Steve] And when we did, it was

not the hit that we were hoping for.

[in Spanish]

Forgive me, Gorilla, I don't feel well.

Miss Diana...

why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

You are loyal like a sheep,

aren't you?

That man is your kidnapper... and mine,

and that of the whole nation.

Here, you go first.

- [a*t*matic g*n]

- [indistinct shouts in Spanish]

[men shouting]

Hide in here, quickly!

[Steve] Who would've thought a failed raid

would result in Escobar's biggest victory?

Pablo didn't even have

to pull the trigger. We did it for him.

[Carrillo in English]

Guys, we have a problem.

[Steve] For the battle-fatigued

citizens of Colombia,

Diana's death was the final straw.

This wasn't just an oligarch dying.

Her presence on the nation's TV screens

and in their homes transcended class.

The people were devastated.

For President Gaviria,

there was little room left to move.

[speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

[Nydia] Mr. President!

You k*ll my daughter.

Let her pass.

Wait...

If you had accepted his terms,

my daughter would still be alive!

Give him whatever he wants.

Don't let others go through the suffering

we've had to endure.

Mr. President... we need to leave.

God be with you, Nydia.

[sighs]

There's something

I want to make very clear.

You are not to blame for Diana's death.

OK? That has to be clear.

Escobar has the resources

for this to go on forever.

Yes, and so do we.

We are the state.

We are going to fight, do whatever we have

to do, and we are going to finish him.

We have options.

For instance, why don't we allow

the American military to come in?

I know-- We don't like it.

I personally don't like it.

But if it's a specific, clear mission--

- No.

- Something covert.

No!

It's time to end all of this.

Give Escobar what he wants.

[Eduardo] Let's go.

[Javier in English] If your Congress

abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.

- We're a paper f*cking tiger!

- Everything we have done is lost.

[Eduardo] We have no choice.

The people, the public... it's tired

of all these b*mb and bloodshed!

Right, and business goes as usual,

- he just runs it from that jail.

- Exactly!

All things considered,

it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.

For public relations?

It's capitulation.

You want Escobar.

Why?

Why?

Because you want to parade him

in your DEA jackets?

You think this is a game, right?

This is Colombia,

and our people want peace!

This is not a f*cking game!

[in Spanish] Well...

at this time, our friend, Fernando,

is going to tell us a little something.

[clears throat]

The Colombian government is going

to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

accepting only one simple charge:

drug tr*ffick.

And...

they are going to let him build a jail

which the police

cannot be within three kilometers of.

At last...

we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

- Long live Colombia, f*ck.

- ¡Viva!

- Fernando...

- Mm?

- ...thank you very much.

- No problem, Pablo.

And do you know when Congress

is going to vote to abolish extradition?

Mm! Yes, it's--

It's a matter of... of weeks.

And at that time, you will be able

to turn yourself over to the authorities.

It pleases me very much to finish my work

with you with such a great victory.

No, brother. Now is when I am

going to need your services the most.

- How-- How's that?

- Fernando...

now it's time for us to find legal means

to reduce my sentence even more.

Right?

[chuckles]

[sighs]

And what does this mean for us, huh?

It means, my love...

that now I have a jail.

And for you,

visiting days will be...

- every day.

- [laughs]

- I'm serious, Pablo.

- So am I.

[sighs]

The problem, Pablo, is that...

now that you have admitted

to tr*ffick in narcotics,

my image as a journalist

cannot be associated with yours.

[Pablo] Hm.

So then...

now you think I am going to damage your

credibility as a journalist... is that it?

You understand what I'm saying.

Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

I think that... it's time for me

to set you free, so that...

you can find a boyfriend who's honest...

so that you can get a little house,

have little kids,

- little dogs...

- Don't joke around, Pablo.

No, I'm not joking.

[softly] I just want you to know...

that you, Valeria...

are a bandit, just like me.

So don't come to me with bullshit.

Looks like you got away with it,

eh, assh*le?

Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

Geniuses...

are always branded as crazy.

- Am I right?

- Yeah.

- The Ochoas...

- The Ochoas what?

You can bet

they're going to be pissed off.

Because of the treaty?

Or because you're f*cking their sister?

That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

Let's hope they don't

charge you for it later.

[Steve] The race was on.

Pablo needed to build his jail

as fast as possible.

As for his enemies, they needed

to get to him before that happened.

As soon as he walked inside,

Pablo would be safe.

And everyone on the outside wouldn't.

[in English] We got an official cease

and desist order for any further operation

when Pablo officially surrenders.

- Search Bloc is gonna be disbanded.

- [Javier] We heard the terms.

- No cops within two miles of the prison.

- This is a f*cking sham.

It's a death warrant for my men.

I won't be able to protect them.

I won't let that happen.

There are cops that hate Escobar

just as much as I do.

More.

They're not gonna stop

just because they're told to.

You talking about vigilantes?

Call it what you like... but I'm still

gonna need those intel reports.

- We'll get you anything we find.

- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.

They know we've been helping.

One more and we're out.

I thought you said you were all in.

[in Spanish]

The soccer field will be over here.

Here, I want to have

a little doll house for Manuela,

and downstairs,

a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

My family will live in a house

down the hill.

I'm going to install a telescope

so I can look at them whenever I want.

Yeah, right. More like

you can look at other girls' asses.

No. The family, the family.

To see my kids.

- What can we do to help you, Pablo?

- Well...

while we're in prison,

Gustavo and me,

I will count on you, Moncada, and you,

Galeano, to oversee operations.

Thank you, Pablo.

We're privileged to be given

that responsibility. You can count on us.

We've already spoken about the operational

plan and everything's clear, right?

Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

Did you tell them about the tax?

- No, I didn't.

- The tax?

What tax is this?

Who paid for the w*r we fought?

You.

- You, Don Pablo.

- That's right.

We have peace now.

You're going to directly

benefit from that.

It's only fair that you contribute

to the legal and security costs

that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

And about how much will that be?

We agreed to what,

$200,000 a month, right?

Yes, 200 grand.

200 grand?

That's a lot of money, brother.

A lot of money.

But consider it done.

And again... thank you

very much for this responsibility,

- and for considering us.

- All right, then.

- Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.

- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

Why should I let them

reap the fruits of our labor

without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

I agree with you.

But right now, we really

need those two f*g to be loyal.

And what?

You don't think I inspire loyalty?

My loyalty?

Yes, you know you have it.

But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

You know, the thing is, Pablo...

you won.

There's no arguing that.

But you gave in.

And there are people

who will see that as weakness.

We've gotta keep our enemies close,

now more than ever.

- [waiter murmurs in Spanish]

- [Valeria] Thank you.

It's great to see you again, Valeria.

Likewise, Pacho.

I'm very happy to see you.

Although, I must say...

it was a little unexpected.

We are worried about you.

And... why are ""we"" worried?

Pablo's cutting a deal

with the government.

He's going to have

to admit to certain things.

Things that may damage

your reputation by association.

If I'm good at anything,

it's protecting my reputation.

Listen, this time it's different.

Look... you helped create

that ""Robin Hood Paisa"" bullshit.

And when it all goes to shit, you'll have

to take responsibility for that.

Maybe he tricked me, too.

Like the rest of the world.

You have enemies, see?

They're not gonna

let you get away with it.

Look, Valeria...

we have a lot of connections in New York,

a strong presence, you could say.

You should go there,

at least for a little while.

And leave Colombia.

There are a million Colombians there.

A new audience.

And they don't care if you shared your bed

with a monster or not.

- [sighs]

- Just for a while.

When this is all over, you'll be able to

come back here with your head held high,

I guarantee it.

And not only that, you'll have earned

a brand-new audience in the United States.

- Betrayal is not my style.

- What betrayal?

And what would you be betraying?

Your role as his mistress?

You remain loyal to a man who has never

thought you good enough to be his wife.

His wife? Me?

No, no, no,

you're very much mistaken, my dear.

The last thing I want

is to be married to him.

Besides...

do you think I'd want to be his wife?

Do you think I want to be locked up,

waiting all day at the Monaco building,

while he's out with...

with me?

No.

That's too boring.

- [Tata moans]

- [Pablo grunting]

I missed you so much.

I missed you, too.

- [Pablo grunts]

- [moaning]

No, it was terrible.

It was terrible.

Every day in a different house...

worried about you...

the kids...

[sighs]

The truth is...

it's very good to be home.

- You look happy.

- Of course.

[soft chuckle]

That time has passed.

It's the happiest face I've ever seen

on a man about to go to jail.

[expl*si*n]

- [shouting outside]

- [alarm blaring]

The kids!

[screams] The kids, Pablo!

- The kids!

- No, Tata!

- I have to go to them!

- Stay here!

- [sobbing] My children!

- Stay here!

I'll go get them. Stay here.

- [Tata sobs]

- [alarm continues]

- Juan Pablo!

- [Manuela crying]

Juan Pablo!

- Are you OK?

- Yes.

Come on.

Go to your mother.

Go to your mother.

- [sobbing]

- Come on, come on.

[sirens wailing outside]

[crashing]

[Steve] The expl*si*n was

from a car b*mb on the street below,

about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.

It made little Manuela

forever deaf in one ear.

- [whispers in Spanish]

- [Steve] In this w*r,

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

the innocent always seemed

to be the ones who got hurt.

For Escobar, the Monaco b*mb

told him two things:

First, it showed him that the cops

weren't his biggest problem.

They would never use a b*mb.

This was a new player, one that

wasn't above going after his family.

[in Spanish] Don't worry, cousin.

We're going to k*ll them all.

[Steve] Second, and the one

that f*cked with his head the most...

was that for the first time in his life...

someone had given him up.

And worse yet,

he had no idea who.

[phone ringing]

[in Spanish] Hello?

[man] Valeria, there was an attempted hit

at the Monaco building.

- Just now?

- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car b*mb.

- Who was inside?

- We don't know.

[stammers]

What other information do you have?

That's all the information

we have right now.

OK, thanks.

[Fabio]

He always takes her to the same motel.

[approaching footsteps]

- Marina.

- Where are you going?

I'm going to the city.

I have to get out of this prison.

- Come here, Marina.

- Yes?

Have a good time.

Be safe.

Thanks.

[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

You know what he's going to do, right?

He's going to continue conducting

his business behind those walls

that are protected

by the Colombian government.

We should give him credit.

The man is a genius.

Well... all the more reason

that we should negotiate our surrender.

But you know that Pablo

took it upon himself to close that door.

So we need to take advantage

of your political contacts,

especially General Jaramillo.

Can you talk to him for us?

Yes, of course.

But I don't think it will be enough.

[Jorge]

What are you saying?

That you're going

to have to offer something more,

something that interests them enough

to make a deal with you.

Gustavo Gaviria.

He is the key to Pablo's business.

If that son of a bitch goes down,

the whole empire goes down.

Indeed, that could work.

That could work.

[Steve] It is often said

there is no honor among thieves.

That's doubly true of drug dealers.

The Ochoas, with the help of Cali,

made their own surrender deal.

No extradition, no stiff sentence.

The Colombian government

was willing to overlook their part

in the largest cocaine empire

on the face of the earth.

Instead, they would

serve reduced sentences.

- The charge?

- [in Spanish] Follow me.

Illegally importing bulls from Spain.

I shit you not.

They went to jail

with smiles on their faces,

'cause all they had to do

was use their sister as bait

to catch a fish the cops actually wanted.

[Marina in Spanish] Kiss me.

- You look pretty, baby.

- Yeah, sure.

What I mean is

you've always looked pretty.

Gustavo.

[Marina] What's happening?

[Gustavo] Nothing.

Nothing is happening here.

Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?

That's up to you.

- Say goodbye.

- [Marina] No.

No, no, no.

Gustavo, look at me. Gustav--

Does your family know where you are?

- Gustavo!

- Calm down, Marina.

[Gustavo]

You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.

We're already in negotiations

with the government.

- You have no reason to be doing this.

- You're right.

That's why I'm not here.

Then what the f*ck do you want?

Don't act stupid.

Give me your cousin...

and I'll let you live.

[sighs]

All right.

k*ll me, then, f*ck.

I won't do that myself.

But I want to introduce you to some people

who would love to do it for me.

This guy? This is Lastia.

His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá

in a b*mb you coordinated.

She was 17 years old.

And this guy here...

this is Trujillo.

You k*ll his father

and his brother for being cops.

- That has nothing to do with me.

- No?

You know...

if you support evil, you are evil.

Look at them.

I just want you to look at their faces.

A few of the victims

you've left in your wake.

Tell me...

have you ever felt

the swift vengeance of justice?

Give me your cousin...

or I'll let these men

show you that vengeance with their fists.

Do it, then...

you sons of bitches.

OK, then.

We'll see how you feel...

after ten minutes.

Do it.

[grunts]

- [heavy punches landing]

- [Gustavo grunts, groans]

[shaky exhale]

[wheezing]

Tell me where your cousin is.

It doesn't have to end like this.

[sputters]

[coughing]

Tell me where your cousin is.

[panting]

We...

are bandits...

not snitches, f*ck.

[Gustavo laughs]

[shouts] You're--

You're all gonna die, f*ck!

You're all d*ad, f*ck!

You're all d*ad, f*ck!

You, your families,

your wives are all d*ad, f*ck!

You're all d*ad!

Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

Colonel, they're going

to make us pay for this.

Report his death as a result

of a sh**t-out with the police.

Make sure you report that he fired first.

But Colonel, he's all b*at up.

That work for you?

There is nothing... more beautiful

and more important in my life than this.

We're all here together... united.

Now let's eat and enjoy

this marvelous food.

- Wait, wait.

- Oh, yeah, the beets.

- Tata?

- Boss?

Hello, son. Have a seat.

- Sit down--

- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

Tell me like a man.

- Gustavo is d*ad.

- What?

They found his body on the outskirts

of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

[Hermilda] How's that?

They also sh*t him, boss.

No, no!

How dare you come to my house saying that!

How dare you!

Leave! Get out of my house!

You... you are leaving right now!

Get out of my house! Go on!

No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...

Go on! Get out of here!

[whispers] It's OK.

Everything's going to be fine.

[sobbing]

Are you sure about this?

[softly] Yes, boss.

I want you to take him

to the funeral home...

and guard his body the entire time

until it's buried.

- All right.

- Go on.

[door opens]

How are you doing, son?

I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.

When...

you were nine... or ten...

do you remember?

How you would

ride around on your bicycles.

[chuckles]

You'd go up into the mountains

and just disappear.

The whole day would go by...

Oh, my.

And we would call you...

We seemed crazy,

yelling for you all over the place...

until finally you would appear.

Oh, my God.

""Where were you?""

""Where have you been, son?""

I would yell out.

""In the mountains, Mama.""

""Higher than the clouds, Auntie,""

Gustavo would say, laughing.

He...

He always wanted to go farther.

He always did.

- But with you.

- [sighs]

Only with you.

I didn't think it would end this way.

[breath trembling]

Good afternoon.

[low murmurs]

Boss? Someone came

all the way out here to see you.

Miss Valeria.

Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

What's she doing here?

I'm here only because

I have important information.

I hope it's very important.

It's about Gustavo.

Tell us, then.

I've been told the Ochoa brothers

have been seen in Cali.

They are the ones

who turned Gustavo over,

in exchange for the cartel helping them

seal a deal with the government.

How do you know that?

You know me, Pablo.

I have my ways.

Who in Cali?

Pacho Herrera.

[Steve]

Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,

so he ordered his sicarios

to hit them during a soccer match.

- It was very effective.

- [overlapping g*n]

He did get 14 Cali men that day.

The problem was, everyone on

the soccer field was dressed the same.

[men grunting]

- [g*n clicking]

- By the time the sicarios spotted Pacho,

he was already running away.

[somber Latin song playing]

[priest in Spanish]

""Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

Will your wrath burn like f*re?

Remember how fleeting is my life,

for what futility

you have created the children of men.""

[Steve] Pablo had Gustavo

buried in the hills of Medellín,

- where the cousins had played as kids.

- [sniffling]

In his mind,

losing his best friend

was a price he had to pay

to defeat extradition.

So he ordered the burial

to take place at the exact same time

- that Congress was voting to repeal it.

- [inaudible dialogue]

Whether it was Gaviria's support,

Pablo's ""plata or plomo,""

or maybe people

were just sick of the v*olence...

extradition was defeated by a landslide.

Hours after the vote,

a military helicopter

was dispatched to coordinates

just outside Medellín,

where Pablo was waiting.

[Eduardo in Spanish] As you know,

I come on behalf of President Gaviria

and the Colombian government.

This is the offer of our terms

for your surrender.

[Steve] Peña and I

had to go see it with our own eyes.

A t*rror1st, a drug dealer and a m*rder

surrendering to a grateful nation

who gave him everything he asked for.

It was the closest we'd ever come to him,

and we never felt further away.

[Pablo in Spanish] All right, then.

Let me hand over my g*n.

- You won.

- We both did.

Now Gaviria can announce

that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

Except that's not so true.

You and I know it's a big lie.

Mm.

Lies are necessary... when the truth

is too difficult to believe. Right?

[Steve]

It wasn't a f*cking surrender.

Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.

He was escaping it.

And all anyone could do was watch.

Once again, Escobar had used v*olence

to bend the world to his will.

They called it ""la gran mentira,""

""the big lie.""

And it was a lie.

Except as I watched him

fly away to his luxury prison...

I couldn't help but think

there was some truth in it.

[Steve mutters] Damn it. f*ck.

A truth that I hadn't

been willing to accept.

He'd b*at us because

he was willing to do what we weren't.

Bad guys don't play by the rules.

That's what makes 'em bad.

Maybe that's what lets 'em win.

[Poison in Spanish] Lagarto,

are we gonna party tonight or what?

[in English] I got Poison at 400

to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.

La Dispensaria.

So who do we give this to? DEA?

- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.

- Peña's an assh*le.

- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.

- Sure.

[Steve] I made a promise to myself

that when the time came

that I could strike a blow

against Escobar,

even if it meant breaking the rules,

oh, I was gonna do it.

- Hello?

- [man] Hey, Central Spike here.

[Carrillo in Spanish] All right.

[up-tempo Latin music playing]

[Steve] You wanna tell me a good guy

wouldn't have pushed the buttons

on these f*ck?

You wanna call me a bad guy?

- [overlapping g*n]

- [screaming]

Fine. But if you do, it just means

that you haven't met enough bad guys yet

to know the difference.

There's one thing I've learned

down here in Colombia,

- good and bad are relative concepts.

- [up-tempo Latin song plays]

♪ Yesterday, I fought the devil

Who they say is very brave ♪

♪ I hacked him with my machete so bad

That even I got freaked out ♪

♪ I jumped back, dodging his attack ♪

♪ And in one fell swoop

I cut off his tail ♪

01x07 - You Will Cry Tears of Blood,"[<div class=""content"">This is one of the<br/>
largest and most mysterious plane crashes<br/>
<br/>
in Colombian history.<br/>
<br/>
It may have been a b*mb<br/>
that blew up a plane in Colombia today.<br/>
<br/>
The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...<br/>
<br/>
In his unsuccessful attempt<br/>
<br/>
to assassinate presidential candidate<br/>
C?sar Gaviria,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar m*rder<br/>
107 innocent people.<br/>
<br/>
The ""Paisa Robin Hood""...<br/>
had become a t*rror1st.<br/>
<br/>
But American intelligence authorities<br/>
<br/>
say the drug bosses in Colombia<br/>
have to be considered prime suspects.<br/>
<br/>
You know where Jaime is?<br/>
<br/>
No, sir.<br/>
I don't know where he is.<br/>
<br/>
He left home and hasn't returned.<br/>
<br/>
- Have Pablo and his men come by here?<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
- Your name is Natalie?<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,<br/>
was he with Pablo's sicarios?<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
- Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then, why do you have<br/>
this picture of Pablo in your house?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing wrong with that.<br/>
Everyone in the comuna has one.<br/>
<br/>
You think those thugs<br/>
are going to protect you?<br/>
<br/>
You don't understand...<br/>
that you represent a big problem for them.<br/>
<br/>
We can help you.<br/>
<br/>
We can protect you.<br/>
But you have to tell us the truth.<br/>
<br/>
She's lying.<br/>
<br/>
He's got this poor sucker to carry a b*mb<br/>
without him even knowing it.<br/>
<br/>
- Well, maybe he knew.<br/>
- I don't care if he knew or not.<br/>
<br/>
It's time we put a b*llet in Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want<br/>
to leave, my love. I don't want to leave.<br/>
<br/>
But I must, for all our safety.<br/>
<br/>
Did you do something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Your dad did nothing wrong.<br/>
<br/>
These are people who are jealous of us,<br/>
who are trying to take what we have.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be strong.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to be strong.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be strong<br/>
and never show weakness.<br/>
<br/>
I promise I'll never be weak.<br/>
<br/>
And watch out for your sister.<br/>
<br/>
I love you very much.<br/>
<br/>
I love you all very much.<br/>
<br/>
- Mama.<br/>
- Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
- Do not spoil this boy.<br/>
- But... what do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
- Watch her.<br/>
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful, son. Be careful.<br/>
<br/>
- I love you.<br/>
- Me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
<br/>
And what about you?<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
I'm going to take you with me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to take you with me...<br/>
I'm going to take you with me.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
<br/>
You think he did it?<br/>
<br/>
Surely not.<br/>
<br/>
Blow up that plane?<br/>
<br/>
Of course he did it, Hermilda.<br/>
<br/>
But he had his reasons.<br/>
<br/>
We've got everyone looking<br/>
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to find her and k*ll her.<br/>
<br/>
And k*ll any f*ck that<br/>
can connect me with that f*cking plane.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
...the functions<br/>
of President of Colombia?<br/>
<br/>
I swear.<br/>
<br/>
The Avianca b*mb created<br/>
a tidal wave of support for C?sar Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
He became the 28th President of Colombia<br/>
by a landslide.<br/>
<br/>
Well, C?sar, congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
Not C?sar... I mean, Mr. President.<br/>
<br/>
Salud.<br/>
<br/>
- Salud.<br/>
- Salud.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse us.<br/>
<br/>
- As a former president to a new one...<br/>
- Mm-hm?<br/>
<br/>
...what advice would you give?<br/>
<br/>
Well... you'll be asked<br/>
to make many difficult decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I would say one thing...<br/>
do what your wife says.<br/>
<br/>
I always do.<br/>
<br/>
Trust your instincts,<br/>
and be confident in your decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Yes...<br/>
<br/>
but that's easier said than done.<br/>
<br/>
You'll never be able to please everyone,<br/>
<br/>
so find the solution<br/>
that rings true in your heart.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I did want to tell you,<br/>
about the Americans--<br/>
<br/>
What about the Americans?<br/>
<br/>
This will have to be off the record,<br/>
my dear.<br/>
<br/>
I can't have my opinions<br/>
broadcast on your television show.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
You have my word.<br/>
<br/>
- The Americans...<br/>
- Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Be careful.<br/>
<br/>
We k*ll Jos? Rodr?guez<br/>
Gacha with a minimal loss of life.<br/>
<br/>
Bringing Escobar to justice<br/>
is my number one priority.<br/>
<br/>
But we will do so<br/>
on our own terms and own resources.<br/>
<br/>
We wanna help you catch Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I have enormous gratitude to you,<br/>
especially with Agent Murphy,<br/>
<br/>
whose warnings kept me off that plane.<br/>
<br/>
You, sir, yes. Unfortunately,<br/>
not the rest of the passengers.<br/>
<br/>
The people in Colombia are horrified<br/>
about the b*mb of Avianca's plane.<br/>
<br/>
But they're also against<br/>
American soldiers on our soil<br/>
<br/>
and spy planes intercepting calls, so--<br/>
<br/>
America doesn't intercept<br/>
civilian phone calls. That's absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Presidente, you need<br/>
additional resources to get this man.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
your government's research says...<br/>
<br/>
660 tons of cocaine were consumed<br/>
in the United States last year.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if your resources<br/>
were focused at home,<br/>
<br/>
we'd all be better off.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria made good<br/>
on his promise to go after Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc<br/>
was set loose with a vengeance.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.<br/>
<br/>
But with an army of informants,<br/>
Escobar somehow always got away.<br/>
<br/>
We sat on the sidelines,<br/>
hands tied by bureaucracy.<br/>
<br/>
In response, Pablo took<br/>
his narco-terrorism to a whole new level<br/>
<br/>
with a b*mb campaign that would<br/>
shake the country to its foundations.<br/>
<br/>
In doing his best to avoid w*r,<br/>
that's exactly what Gaviria got.<br/>
<br/>
And the toll on both sides<br/>
was devastating.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about w*r is...<br/>
it's just bad for business.<br/>
<br/>
And when you got a bull's-eye<br/>
on your back... your rivals get bold.<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo.<br/>
- What's up, Pacho?<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo and the Medell?n cartel<br/>
weren't the only game in town.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
This is Helmer ""Pacho"" Herrera, one<br/>
of the four leaders of the Cali cartel.<br/>
<br/>
While Pablo left a trail of bodies<br/>
and chaos in his wake,<br/>
<br/>
Cali made problems disappear with an army<br/>
of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs.<br/>
<br/>
The Medell?n cartel was Miami:<br/>
<br/>
swimming pools, bikini girls...<br/>
tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.<br/>
<br/>
The Cali cartel was New York:<br/>
<br/>
elegant, smooth, subtle.<br/>
<br/>
Where they could fuel<br/>
the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine,<br/>
<br/>
and still make sure everybody showed up<br/>
for work on Wall Street the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
At first, Medell?n and Cali<br/>
worked side by side.<br/>
<br/>
But in Colombia, when money's involved,<br/>
blood inevitably flows.<br/>
<br/>
There had been v*olence<br/>
between Medell?n and Cali before.<br/>
<br/>
But right now, a w*r on two fronts<br/>
was not something Pablo could afford.<br/>
<br/>
We have Miami...<br/>
and have left you alone in New York.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, for a price.<br/>
- Certainly.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would<br/>
share the Los Angeles territory...<br/>
<br/>
and that hasn't been happening.<br/>
<br/>
It seems you are not<br/>
holding up our agreement.<br/>
<br/>
- How's that?<br/>
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Pablo...<br/>
<br/>
you know that our partners<br/>
sometimes operate independently.<br/>
<br/>
If Mr. Galeano<br/>
and Mr. Moncada are correct,<br/>
<br/>
then you have my assurance<br/>
that it will be rectified.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Disputes between us<br/>
cause needless bloodshed.<br/>
<br/>
Then fix it. A w*r between our groups<br/>
is the last thing we need right now.<br/>
<br/>
It would seem you already have a w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe b*mb that plane<br/>
was a step too far.<br/>
<br/>
Careful, Pacho.<br/>
<br/>
Careful.<br/>
The only difference between us<br/>
<br/>
is our little misunderstanding<br/>
with the government.<br/>
<br/>
And that will be resolved soon.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, that's the business,<br/>
for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, it's true for all of us.<br/>
- Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
The only w*r we are really fighting<br/>
is the w*r against extradition.<br/>
<br/>
And the outcome of that<br/>
is something we're all interested in.<br/>
<br/>
It's true, Gustavo.<br/>
Gustavo is right.<br/>
<br/>
We have a common goal,<br/>
and that is to get rid of extradition.<br/>
<br/>
The United States is big enough<br/>
for all of us to operate in.<br/>
<br/>
Let's figure out Los Angeles<br/>
once you take care of your business here.<br/>
<br/>
You know what bothers me?<br/>
<br/>
Your arrogance.<br/>
<br/>
Your attitude, your air of superiority.<br/>
<br/>
Careful, Pacho... that you don't<br/>
get yourself k*ll for that.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for coming.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm gonna k*ll that h*m* bastard.<br/>
- Pablo, let me k*ll him.<br/>
<br/>
Stop talking shit, Moncada.<br/>
<br/>
We'll k*ll that f*g later.<br/>
Right now, we can't be out in the open.<br/>
<br/>
If that son of a bitch<br/>
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,<br/>
<br/>
I'm personally gonna put a g*n up his ass<br/>
and pull the trigger. I swear.<br/>
<br/>
That will make him fall in love with you.<br/>
<br/>
We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:<br/>
<br/>
Poison, La Quica, Sure sh*t, Blackie.<br/>
<br/>
Cocky, careless f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Now we're hearing about two new guys:<br/>
<br/>
Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada,<br/>
<br/>
basically picking up<br/>
where Carlos Lehder left off.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll the body, the head will die.<br/>
<br/>
Without Colombian permission<br/>
to put assets in the air, we can't help.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of intercepts, yeah,<br/>
but what do you guys got on ground intel?<br/>
<br/>
- You mean spies?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have any narco assets.<br/>
<br/>
Our human intelligence<br/>
is limited to communists.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you<br/>
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.<br/>
<br/>
But you got satellites<br/>
in the sky, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos<br/>
would be a direct violation<br/>
<br/>
- of the order of our host country.<br/>
- Man, you're CIA.<br/>
<br/>
You break rules all the time.<br/>
<br/>
These are aerial photographs of comunas<br/>
controlled by Escobar and his associates.<br/>
<br/>
- We'll use them to track his men.<br/>
- These are aerials.<br/>
<br/>
- We can't track individuals with these.<br/>
- Take a look.<br/>
<br/>
The Los Priscos g*ng controls El Poblado.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna<br/>
where they recruited the Avianca b*mb.<br/>
<br/>
And both places more densely packed<br/>
than a Marrakesh bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
So let's take a tip from the Colombians.<br/>
<br/>
You notice anything special about these?<br/>
<br/>
Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic<br/>
in the comunas. You've got...<br/>
<br/>
Japanese imports... four-by-fours.<br/>
Cars over 40 grand.<br/>
<br/>
Narcos are the only ones<br/>
who can afford these cars.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever aerials see these cars,<br/>
we know sicarios are inside.<br/>
<br/>
- That's right.<br/>
- We start tracking these rice rockets,<br/>
<br/>
we might be able to get to Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's up this way.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to sh**t her.<br/>
<br/>
k*ll that cute girl?<br/>
And the baby, too?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why the boss<br/>
wants us to k*ll that girl.<br/>
<br/>
- What does she know about Avianca anyway?<br/>
- Just shut up and follow orders!<br/>
<br/>
Does he think<br/>
putting a b*mb on every corner<br/>
<br/>
is gonna get the police<br/>
to quit chasing him?<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo, we need to get away,<br/>
out of this country.<br/>
<br/>
And go where?<br/>
<br/>
We'll be treated like criminals<br/>
wherever we go.<br/>
<br/>
They'll k*ll him, and you know it.<br/>
<br/>
I just hope he doesn't<br/>
take you down with him.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't our w*r.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't w*r. It's negotiation.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you understand<br/>
what an opportunity this is?<br/>
<br/>
He's willing to consider<br/>
terms of surrender--<br/>
<br/>
Under what conditions?<br/>
<br/>
My God, he just blew up a plane!<br/>
<br/>
Eduardo, calm down.<br/>
Let the man speak.<br/>
<br/>
We can end this v*olence<br/>
with dignity. It's good for both sides--<br/>
<br/>
Do you realize<br/>
how stupid you sound right now?<br/>
<br/>
C?sar, this is absurd.<br/>
<br/>
- Eduardo, please--<br/>
- This is a farce.<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
Let me deal with this. Please.<br/>
<br/>
Fine. Whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
We can at least begin a discussion, right?<br/>
<br/>
Even though you never stated it,<br/>
<br/>
surely you'd like<br/>
to see the b*mb stop.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes. Yes, I would.<br/>
- Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
So if we begin a dialogue,<br/>
they will cease.<br/>
<br/>
That affords us all some time,<br/>
including the Search Bloc.<br/>
<br/>
Fernando...<br/>
<br/>
you saw his money,<br/>
and it blinded you to his soul.<br/>
<br/>
That son of a bitch has no soul.<br/>
<br/>
If telling him we're negotiating<br/>
<br/>
allows the b*mb to stop<br/>
while we find him...<br/>
<br/>
then be my guest.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
Really, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Look, man,<br/>
Pablo's turned into a saint.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
He sends people straight to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
She's not here.<br/>
She might have just left.<br/>
<br/>
Let's search the comuna.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Poison, I'm telling you<br/>
Pablo is being paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
Careful what you say, son.<br/>
<br/>
One day,<br/>
he is going to ask me to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
Would you do it?<br/>
<br/>
If he asks me... of course.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way around it.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you?<br/>
<br/>
All right, all right,<br/>
let's just go find this girl.<br/>
<br/>
We'll look around<br/>
and see where she's hiding.<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
It's OK, Natalie.<br/>
Don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
Before you know it, we'll get you<br/>
some food. Right? Isn't that right?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
What then, Fernando?<br/>
<br/>
Has the Colombian government<br/>
offered a truce?<br/>
<br/>
The government<br/>
hasn't been willing to offer anything<br/>
<br/>
I would consider acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
What did they offer?<br/>
<br/>
They want you to admit...<br/>
<br/>
that you're responsible for Avianca.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, I told them that--<br/>
That we can't even--<br/>
<br/>
Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?<br/>
<br/>
No, no, of course I'm negotiating--<br/>
<br/>
Then why is Carrillo<br/>
stopping every car in the comunas<br/>
<br/>
and k*ll my boys<br/>
with the help of the gringos?!<br/>
<br/>
Why are the Americans helping them if we<br/>
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know<br/>
he's willing to negotiate with you.<br/>
<br/>
That's it.<br/>
<br/>
Be very careful, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
You've got to stop the b*mb, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should...<br/>
<br/>
reorganize a bit...<br/>
<br/>
and start sending our boys out to burn<br/>
some houses down and do some damage<br/>
<br/>
to politicians and senators<br/>
all over the country.<br/>
<br/>
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,<br/>
the judges who annoy us<br/>
<br/>
and the reporters that watch us,<br/>
<br/>
basically, we have to create a presence so<br/>
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.<br/>
<br/>
That's the only way<br/>
we're going to get there.<br/>
<br/>
Is that it? Is that what you want?<br/>
A civil w*r?<br/>
<br/>
- You've gone crazy, assh*le.<br/>
- We have to fight, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Let's put our hearts into this.<br/>
<br/>
And if we all must die, so be it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes...<br/>
<br/>
The thing is,<br/>
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Nor do I.<br/>
<br/>
But the b*mb make the public want peace.<br/>
<br/>
And that will influence the politicians.<br/>
<br/>
You're the one who says the politicians<br/>
don't give a shit about the public.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to influence politicians,<br/>
you'll have to narrow your focus.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo was right.<br/>
<br/>
They needed a new strategy,<br/>
<br/>
one that brought terror directly<br/>
to the people that mattered the most.<br/>
<br/>
What about her?<br/>
<br/>
No, she is way too much of a princess.<br/>
<br/>
Surely we would have problems with her.<br/>
<br/>
My God, look at that face.<br/>
<br/>
The media is going to love that fox,<br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
Sure they will,<br/>
but so will our boys.<br/>
<br/>
Just think what<br/>
they're gonna do to her.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
I say let's start with her...<br/>
<br/>
...and this f*g.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
And this cute couple.<br/>
<br/>
When you k*ll someone, you lose<br/>
all your leverage the moment they're d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you take someone's children<br/>
away from them,<br/>
<br/>
you'd be amazed<br/>
what they'd do to get them back.<br/>
<br/>
Family members of<br/>
the most influential people in the country<br/>
<br/>
have been kidnapped<br/>
on the very streets they call home.<br/>
<br/>
What does Pablo Escobar want?<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel<br/>
for a special report.<br/>
<br/>
Is everything all right?<br/>
<br/>
All the victims are my friends.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,<br/>
<br/>
the editor in chief of the most important<br/>
newspaper in the nation,<br/>
<br/>
is the latest and most shocking<br/>
in a string of kidnappings<br/>
<br/>
orchestrated by the Medell?n cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.<br/>
<br/>
- All right.<br/>
- First on the scene, right? As always.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you actually<br/>
had to work for a living,<br/>
<br/>
you'd be hungry enough to get here first.<br/>
<br/>
I found out from Santos' wife...<br/>
<br/>
a half hour after<br/>
he didn't show up for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
You?<br/>
<br/>
Who tipped you off?<br/>
<br/>
It's a pleasure to see you,<br/>
as always.<br/>
<br/>
These are Pablo's conditions<br/>
for the release of the hostages.<br/>
<br/>
You've read them,<br/>
you can see they're very reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
""Very reasonable,"" he says.<br/>
<br/>
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm going to tell you something.<br/>
<br/>
You will get what you deserve very soon,<br/>
I assure you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also one of those hostages.<br/>
<br/>
I myself could be walking around calmly...<br/>
but like them, I am not free.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar is asking us to surrender,<br/>
but that will never happen.<br/>
<br/>
If he releases the hostages<br/>
and turns himself in,<br/>
<br/>
we will take this into account.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria isn't going to bend.<br/>
<br/>
Then I'm going to break him.<br/>
<br/>
You, get up from there.<br/>
<br/>
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found<br/>
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.<br/>
<br/>
One must admire President Gaviria.<br/>
I'm sure it can't be easy for him<br/>
<br/>
to stand by his decision<br/>
to not negotiate with Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
What's the plan?<br/>
<br/>
A few more hostages and they will give in.<br/>
<br/>
Their time is running out.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about us.<br/>
<br/>
What about us, Valeria?<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time<br/>
for that p*ssy shit right now.<br/>
<br/>
Colombia's sweetheart.<br/>
<br/>
You know the only reason<br/>
this hag has any fame<br/>
<br/>
is because her father was president.<br/>
<br/>
I despise her.<br/>
<br/>
And why do you care so much?<br/>
<br/>
Your ratings are through the roof, right?<br/>
<br/>
Hers are higher.<br/>
<br/>
Open the door, quick!<br/>
<br/>
Move!<br/>
<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
Hurry up!<br/>
<br/>
Where am I?<br/>
<br/>
Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Tell me where I am.<br/>
<br/>
Does my family know I'm alive?<br/>
<br/>
How would I know?<br/>
<br/>
Who are you?<br/>
<br/>
You work for Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
You can call me Gorilla.<br/>
<br/>
Gorilla.<br/>
<br/>
Very well... Gorilla.<br/>
<br/>
Where's my crew?<br/>
<br/>
Did you bring them here as well?<br/>
<br/>
I'm here to guard you. That's it.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>
excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
We understand the frustration and pain<br/>
you must be feeling for your children,<br/>
<br/>
but believe me,<br/>
we are doing everything we can<br/>
<br/>
to make sure your children get home soon.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter was kidnapped<br/>
on her way to an interview.<br/>
<br/>
They k*ll the bodyguard.<br/>
No one is safe.<br/>
<br/>
As a former president, I understand<br/>
the terrible position you're in.<br/>
<br/>
But we're here to find a solution.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your frustration,<br/>
Dr. Turbay.<br/>
<br/>
But if we give in now, any criminal<br/>
can hold our government hostage.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't ""any criminal.""<br/>
This is the worst criminal in the world.<br/>
<br/>
- And he is laughing at all of us.<br/>
- Mr. President,<br/>
<br/>
you're proceeding as you must, but we must<br/>
act as the parents of our children.<br/>
<br/>
Let's pray you find a solution.<br/>
<br/>
A good president<br/>
can stand up to external pressure.<br/>
<br/>
It's the internal pressure<br/>
that can wear you down.<br/>
<br/>
We knew the clock was ticking before<br/>
Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...<br/>
<br/>
but hopefully not before<br/>
our unauthorized operation struck gold.<br/>
<br/>
Catching a top sicario could be the break<br/>
we needed in leading us to Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Here.<br/>
<br/>
We'd continue to join<br/>
in an ""observational capacity.""<br/>
<br/>
Hands up!<br/>
<br/>
Up!<br/>
<br/>
Why are you driving this car?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos<br/>
to drive it around the city.<br/>
<br/>
The sicarios had figured out<br/>
we were tracking their rides.<br/>
<br/>
So they traded down to junkers<br/>
to avoid our eye in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
But we weren't the only ones<br/>
that had Pablo in the g*n sights.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo came to see me.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
He wants to settle<br/>
the dispute we have in the US.<br/>
<br/>
The Los Angeles problems.<br/>
<br/>
He has bigger issues<br/>
than that right now.<br/>
<br/>
He'll make a deal with the government.<br/>
<br/>
He's managed to secure<br/>
some very effective bargaining chips.<br/>
<br/>
Of course,<br/>
he'll look after you guys, right?<br/>
<br/>
We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.<br/>
He's in hiding.<br/>
<br/>
Look at that.<br/>
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.<br/>
<br/>
You like it?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure he'll look after you.<br/>
After all, you're partners.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course. Partners.<br/>
<br/>
You could always have your sister<br/>
put in a good word with Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm sorry,<br/>
I thought you knew.<br/>
<br/>
It could be gossip.<br/>
You know how people like to talk.<br/>
<br/>
You should eat,<br/>
because you're going to be here a while.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to get very hungry.<br/>
<br/>
I don't feel well.<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong? Are you sick?<br/>
<br/>
I can get you some medicine.<br/>
<br/>
It's not that kind of illness.<br/>
<br/>
I want to congratulate you.<br/>
I know you're a very good reporter.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Gorilla, how long have you been<br/>
working for Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's been a while.<br/>
<br/>
So you know what's going on out there,<br/>
don't you?<br/>
<br/>
The truth is, I don't go out,<br/>
so I have no idea what's happening.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck are you doing, Gorilla?<br/>
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know you were coming.<br/>
<br/>
Put it on, man!<br/>
We have to take her.<br/>
<br/>
Put that on.<br/>
<br/>
- Says who?<br/>
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?<br/>
<br/>
Just put it on.<br/>
<br/>
Pleasure to finally meet you,<br/>
Ms. Turbay.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, please.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you want me to interview you?<br/>
<br/>
No, even better.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to interview you.<br/>
<br/>
So you can tell the world about<br/>
the humane treatment you've received here.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you want your parents<br/>
to know you're well?<br/>
<br/>
That you're alive?<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to become<br/>
a piece of propaganda for you.<br/>
<br/>
Who do you think you are?<br/>
<br/>
So what's necessary, miss,<br/>
to have your cooperation?<br/>
<br/>
Let one of the hostages go.<br/>
<br/>
You and I know that<br/>
I'm the one you really want.<br/>
<br/>
You see?<br/>
<br/>
Two reasonable people<br/>
coming to an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria<br/>
to do the same. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Escobar has shown<br/>
a willingness to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon,<br/>
he let one of the hostages go.<br/>
<br/>
President Gaviria...<br/>
<br/>
I ask you to at least<br/>
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you said he wouldn't bend,<br/>
but now he's let one go.<br/>
<br/>
Because he has your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
And she's worth more to him<br/>
than the rest of them combined.<br/>
<br/>
If you knew all I know, you'd understand<br/>
it's nothing more than a stunt.<br/>
<br/>
Give him what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
What he wants is an insult to us<br/>
and to this country.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care. I want my child!<br/>
<br/>
What I believe<br/>
my wife is trying to say is,<br/>
<br/>
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
If you refuse,<br/>
we'll have to take certain measures.<br/>
<br/>
Financially, by robbing you of donors...<br/>
and politically,<br/>
<br/>
by robbing you of whatever support<br/>
your legislative agenda needs.<br/>
<br/>
Are you thr*at me?<br/>
<br/>
We all use the tools at our disposal.<br/>
<br/>
You as a politician, me as a father.<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Doctor...<br/>
<br/>
you told me to follow my instincts...<br/>
<br/>
and they tell me<br/>
not to give in to this criminal.<br/>
<br/>
That was before they took my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I came over as quickly as I could.<br/>
I was told you needed me urgently.<br/>
<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
You OK?<br/>
<br/>
Tell Fernando...<br/>
I'm willing to open negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
I have to stop this madness, Eduardo.<br/>
<br/>
But God willing,<br/>
we can catch him first.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the Americans<br/>
they can put their planes in the air.<br/>
<br/>
And there it was.<br/>
<br/>
Negotiate with a t*rror1st while<br/>
trying to catch him at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Hammer, we have calls<br/>
originating in Comuna 3,<br/>
<br/>
Manrique, from known<br/>
sicario satellite phones.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a location?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we're here in Campo Vald?s.<br/>
<br/>
Campo Vald?s.<br/>
<br/>
That's in the central eastern area,<br/>
bordered by the Comuna Popular.<br/>
<br/>
Roger that.<br/>
<br/>
Campo Vald?s.<br/>
<br/>
Going into the comunas<br/>
without Colombian backup,<br/>
<br/>
that's about the most dangerous<br/>
thing you can do.<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna<br/>
score a quick goal and then come back out.<br/>
<br/>
All right, all right. All right.<br/>
<br/>
That's how bad<br/>
we wanted to catch these guys.<br/>
<br/>
Don't k*ll me, please!<br/>
<br/>
I swear I didn't hear anything!<br/>
I'm not going to say anything!<br/>
<br/>
Please, don't k*ll me.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm not--<br/>
- Hey! Hey!<br/>
<br/>
- Please, don't k*ll me!<br/>
- What?<br/>
<br/>
I'm begging you, please...<br/>
<br/>
You could have at least waited till<br/>
I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?<br/>
<br/>
You got blood all over my new shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a shit about your shoes.<br/>
Stop bitching.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
What about her?<br/>
<br/>
Put a b*llet in her.<br/>
<br/>
What? The baby's not a witness, man.<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a shit.<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo told us to k*ll everyone.<br/>
- Yeah, but it's a baby.<br/>
<br/>
She won't say shit in court.<br/>
<br/>
If she grows up and talks?<br/>
<br/>
Really? Do you remember<br/>
what your mom told you when you were two?<br/>
<br/>
Why is it so f*cking difficult<br/>
for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Drop the g*n.<br/>
<br/>
Now!<br/>
<br/>
You're under arrest,<br/>
you son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Let him go!<br/>
<br/>
Let him go!<br/>
<br/>
- Put the g*n down.<br/>
- You put yours down.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to have to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
I will.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck!<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Hey...<br/>
<br/>
So those f*g want to sit and negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
we have to spend some time in jail, right?<br/>
<br/>
So what the f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
You won, Pablo. They gave in.<br/>
<br/>
But that f*g president has yet<br/>
to accept our most important demand<br/>
<br/>
before we turn ourselves in.<br/>
<br/>
Which demand is that?<br/>
<br/>
It's been a while<br/>
since we've been up here, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
We used to come up here<br/>
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.<br/>
<br/>
What does that have to do with anything?<br/>
<br/>
I know every centimeter<br/>
of these mountains.<br/>
<br/>
From here,<br/>
we can see anything coming.<br/>
<br/>
And we have enough space<br/>
to build whatever we want.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to design it...<br/>
<br/>
we're going to build it...<br/>
<br/>
and we will be protected<br/>
from all our enemies.<br/>
<br/>
- You want to build a jail?<br/>
- Not a jail, cousin.<br/>
<br/>
A castle.</div>]","This is one of the
largest and most mysterious plane crashes

in Colombian history.

It may have been a b*mb
that blew up a plane in Colombia today.

The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...

In his unsuccessful attempt

to assassinate presidential candidate
C?sar Gaviria,

Pablo Escobar m*rder
107 innocent people.

The ""Paisa Robin Hood""...
had become a t*rror1st.

But American intelligence authorities

say the drug bosses in Colombia
have to be considered prime suspects.

You know where Jaime is?

No, sir.
I don't know where he is.

He left home and hasn't returned.

- Have Pablo and his men come by here?
- No.

- Your name is Natalie?
- Yes, sir.

Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo's sicarios?

- No.
- Are you sure?

Yes, sir.

Well, then, why do you have
this picture of Pablo in your house?

Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

You don't understand...
that you represent a big problem for them.

We can help you.

We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

She's lying.

He's got this poor sucker to carry a b*mb
without him even knowing it.

- Well, maybe he knew.
- I don't care if he knew or not.

It's time we put a b*llet in Escobar.

I don't want
to leave, my love. I don't want to leave.

But I must, for all our safety.

Did you do something wrong?

Your dad did nothing wrong.

These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

You have to be strong.

I want you to be strong.

You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

I promise I'll never be weak.

And watch out for your sister.

I love you very much.

I love you all very much.

- Mama.
- Pablo?

- Do not spoil this boy.
- But... what do you mean?

- Watch her.
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

Be careful, son. Be careful.

- I love you.
- Me, too.

Take care.

And what about you?

Come on.
I'm going to take you with me.

I'm going to take you with me...
I'm going to take you with me.

Take care.

You think he did it?

Surely not.

Blow up that plane?

Of course he did it, Hermilda.

But he had his reasons.

We've got everyone looking
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.

I want you to find her and k*ll her.

And k*ll any f*ck that
can connect me with that f*cking plane.

Yes, sir.

...the functions
of President of Colombia?

I swear.

The Avianca b*mb created
a tidal wave of support for C?sar Gaviria.

He became the 28th President of Colombia
by a landslide.

Well, C?sar, congratulations.

Not C?sar... I mean, Mr. President.

Salud.

- Salud.
- Salud.

Excuse us.

- As a former president to a new one...
- Mm-hm?

...what advice would you give?

Well... you'll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

I would say one thing...
do what your wife says.

I always do.

Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

Yes...

but that's easier said than done.

You'll never be able to please everyone,

so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

Thank you.

Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans--

What about the Americans?

This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

I can't have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

No, no, no.
You have my word.

- The Americans...
- Yes?

Be careful.

We k*ll Jos? Rodr?guez
Gacha with a minimal loss of life.

Bringing Escobar to justice
is my number one priority.

But we will do so
on our own terms and own resources.

We wanna help you catch Escobar.

I have enormous gratitude to you,
especially with Agent Murphy,

whose warnings kept me off that plane.

You, sir, yes. Unfortunately,
not the rest of the passengers.

The people in Colombia are horrified
about the b*mb of Avianca's plane.

But they're also against
American soldiers on our soil

and spy planes intercepting calls, so--

America doesn't intercept
civilian phone calls. That's absurd.

Presidente, you need
additional resources to get this man.

Well...

your government's research says...

660 tons of cocaine were consumed
in the United States last year.

Perhaps if your resources
were focused at home,

we'd all be better off.

Gaviria made good
on his promise to go after Escobar.

Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc
was set loose with a vengeance.

Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.

But with an army of informants,
Escobar somehow always got away.

We sat on the sidelines,
hands tied by bureaucracy.

In response, Pablo took
his narco-terrorism to a whole new level

with a b*mb campaign that would
shake the country to its foundations.

In doing his best to avoid w*r,
that's exactly what Gaviria got.

And the toll on both sides
was devastating.

The thing about w*r is...
it's just bad for business.

And when you got a bull's-eye
on your back... your rivals get bold.

- Pablo.
- What's up, Pacho?

That's right.

Pablo and the Medell?n cartel
weren't the only game in town.

Thank you.

This is Helmer ""Pacho"" Herrera, one
of the four leaders of the Cali cartel.

While Pablo left a trail of bodies
and chaos in his wake,

Cali made problems disappear with an army
of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs.

The Medell?n cartel was Miami:

swimming pools, bikini girls...
tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.

The Cali cartel was New York:

elegant, smooth, subtle.

Where they could fuel
the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine,

and still make sure everybody showed up
for work on Wall Street the next morning.

At first, Medell?n and Cali
worked side by side.

But in Colombia, when money's involved,
blood inevitably flows.

There had been v*olence
between Medell?n and Cali before.

But right now, a w*r on two fronts
was not something Pablo could afford.

We have Miami...
and have left you alone in New York.

- Yes, for a price.
- Certainly.

Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory...

and that hasn't been happening.

It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

- How's that?
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.

Look, Pablo...

you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

If Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada are correct,

then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

Thanks a lot, Pacho.

Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

Then fix it. A w*r between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

It would seem you already have a w*r.

Maybe b*mb that plane
was a step too far.

Careful, Pacho.

Careful.
The only difference between us

is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

And that will be resolved soon.

Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

- Yes, it's true for all of us.
- Mm-hm.

The only w*r we are really fighting
is the w*r against extradition.

And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

You know what bothers me?

Your arrogance.

Your attitude, your air of superiority.

Careful, Pacho... that you don't
get yourself k*ll for that.

Thank you for coming.

- I'm gonna k*ll that h*m* bastard.
- Pablo, let me k*ll him.

Stop talking shit, Moncada.

We'll k*ll that f*g later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

I'm personally gonna put a g*n up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

That will make him fall in love with you.

We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:

Poison, La Quica, Sure sh*t, Blackie.

Cocky, careless f*ck.

Now we're hearing about two new guys:

Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada,

basically picking up
where Carlos Lehder left off.

k*ll the body, the head will die.

Without Colombian permission
to put assets in the air, we can't help.

In terms of intercepts, yeah,
but what do you guys got on ground intel?

- You mean spies?
- Yes.

We don't have any narco assets.

Our human intelligence
is limited to communists.

Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.

But you got satellites
in the sky, right?

Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos
would be a direct violation

- of the order of our host country.
- Man, you're CIA.

You break rules all the time.

These are aerial photographs of comunas
controlled by Escobar and his associates.

- We'll use them to track his men.
- These are aerials.

- We can't track individuals with these.
- Take a look.

The Los Priscos g*ng controls El Poblado.

Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna
where they recruited the Avianca b*mb.

And both places more densely packed
than a Marrakesh bazaar.

So let's take a tip from the Colombians.

You notice anything special about these?

Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic
in the comunas. You've got...

Japanese imports... four-by-fours.
Cars over 40 grand.

Narcos are the only ones
who can afford these cars.

Whenever aerials see these cars,
we know sicarios are inside.

- That's right.
- We start tracking these rice rockets,

we might be able to get to Escobar.

I think it's up this way.

I don't want to sh**t her.

k*ll that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

I don't know why the boss
wants us to k*ll that girl.

- What does she know about Avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

Does he think
putting a b*mb on every corner

is gonna get the police
to quit chasing him?

Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

And go where?

We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

They'll k*ll him, and you know it.

I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

This isn't our w*r.

This isn't w*r. It's negotiation.

Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

He's willing to consider
terms of surrender--

Under what conditions?

My God, he just blew up a plane!

Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

We can end this v*olence
with dignity. It's good for both sides--

Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

C?sar, this is absurd.

- Eduardo, please--
- This is a farce.

Please.

Let me deal with this. Please.

Fine. Whatever you want.

We can at least begin a discussion, right?

Even though you never stated it,

surely you'd like
to see the b*mb stop.

- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

Fernando...

you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

That son of a bitch has no soul.

If telling him we're negotiating

allows the b*mb to stop
while we find him...

then be my guest.

Thank you.
Really, thank you.

Look, man,
Pablo's turned into a saint.

Of course.

He sends people straight to heaven.

She's not here.
She might have just left.

Let's search the comuna.

Look, Poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

Careful what you say, son.

One day,
he is going to ask me to k*ll you.

Would you do it?

If he asks me... of course.

There is no way around it.

Wouldn't you?

All right, all right,
let's just go find this girl.

We'll look around
and see where she's hiding.

What's wrong?

Here you go.

It's OK, Natalie.
Don't worry.

Before you know it, we'll get you
some food. Right? Isn't that right?

Thank you.

What then, Fernando?

Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

I would consider acceptable.

What did they offer?

They want you to admit...

that you're responsible for Avianca.

And of course, I told them that--
That we can't even--

Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

No, no, of course I'm negotiating--

Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

and k*ll my boys
with the help of the gringos?!

Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

That's it.

Be very careful, Fernando.

Yes, Pablo.

Yes.

You've got to stop the b*mb, Pablo.

I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

I think we should...

reorganize a bit...

and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage

to politicians and senators
all over the country.

And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

and the reporters that watch us,

basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.

That's the only way
we're going to get there.

Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil w*r?

- You've gone crazy, assh*le.
- We have to fight, brother.

Let's put our hearts into this.

And if we all must die, so be it.

Well, yes...

The thing is,
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.

Nor do I.

But the b*mb make the public want peace.

And that will influence the politicians.

You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

If you want to influence politicians,
you'll have to narrow your focus.

You know what I mean?

Gustavo was right.

They needed a new strategy,

one that brought terror directly
to the people that mattered the most.

What about her?

No, she is way too much of a princess.

Surely we would have problems with her.

My God, look at that face.

The media is going to love that fox,
right?

Sure they will,
but so will our boys.

Just think what
they're gonna do to her.

Well...

I say let's start with her...

...and this f*g.

Let's go!

And this cute couple.

When you k*ll someone, you lose
all your leverage the moment they're d*ad.

Now, you take someone's children
away from them,

you'd be amazed
what they'd do to get them back.

Family members of
the most influential people in the country

have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

What does Pablo Escobar want?

I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

Is everything all right?

All the victims are my friends.

Excuse me.

The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

orchestrated by the Medell?n cartel.

Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.

- All right.
- First on the scene, right? As always.

Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

you'd be hungry enough to get here first.

I found out from Santos' wife...

a half hour after
he didn't show up for dinner.

You?

Who tipped you off?

It's a pleasure to see you,
as always.

These are Pablo's conditions
for the release of the hostages.

You've read them,
you can see they're very reasonable.

""Very reasonable,"" he says.

You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

And I'm going to tell you something.

You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

I'm also one of those hostages.

I myself could be walking around calmly...
but like them, I am not free.

Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

we will take this into account.

Gaviria isn't going to bend.

Then I'm going to break him.

You, get up from there.

The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

One must admire President Gaviria.
I'm sure it can't be easy for him

to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.

What's the plan?

A few more hostages and they will give in.

Their time is running out.

I'm talking about us.

What about us, Valeria?

I don't have time
for that p*ssy shit right now.

Colombia's sweetheart.

You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

is because her father was president.

I despise her.

And why do you care so much?

Your ratings are through the roof, right?

Hers are higher.

Open the door, quick!

Move!

Let's go!

Hurry up!

Where am I?

Hello!

Tell me where I am.

Does my family know I'm alive?

How would I know?

Who are you?

You work for Escobar?

You can call me Gorilla.

Gorilla.

Very well... Gorilla.

Where's my crew?

Did you bring them here as well?

I'm here to guard you. That's it.

Ladies and gentlemen,
excuse me.

We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

to make sure your children get home soon.

Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

They k*ll the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you're in.

But we're here to find a solution.

I understand your frustration,
Dr. Turbay.

But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

This isn't ""any criminal.""
This is the worst criminal in the world.

- And he is laughing at all of us.
- Mr. President,

you're proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

Let's pray you find a solution.

A good president
can stand up to external pressure.

It's the internal pressure
that can wear you down.

We knew the clock was ticking before
Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...

but hopefully not before
our unauthorized operation struck gold.

Catching a top sicario could be the break
we needed in leading us to Pablo.

Here.

We'd continue to join
in an ""observational capacity.""

Hands up!

Up!

Why are you driving this car?

I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

The sicarios had figured out
we were tracking their rides.

So they traded down to junkers
to avoid our eye in the sky.

But we weren't the only ones
that had Pablo in the g*n sights.

Pablo came to see me.

Why?

He wants to settle
the dispute we have in the US.

The Los Angeles problems.

He has bigger issues
than that right now.

He'll make a deal with the government.

He's managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

Of course,
he'll look after you guys, right?

We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.
He's in hiding.

Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

You like it?

Yes, of course.

I'm sure he'll look after you.
After all, you're partners.

Yes, of course. Partners.

You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

What do you mean?

Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

You should eat,
because you're going to be here a while.

You're going to get very hungry.

I don't feel well.

What's wrong? Are you sick?

I can get you some medicine.

It's not that kind of illness.

I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

Thank you.

Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

Oh, it's been a while.

So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

The truth is, I don't go out,
so I have no idea what's happening.

What the f*ck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

I didn't know you were coming.

Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

Put that on.

- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

Just put it on.

Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

Sit down, please.

I suppose you want me to interview you?

No, even better.

I'm going to interview you.

So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

That you're alive?

I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

Who do you think you are?

So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

Let one of the hostages go.

You and I know that
I'm the one you really want.

You see?

Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

President Gaviria...

I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.

I don't understand.

I thought you said he wouldn't bend,
but now he's let one go.

Because he has your daughter.

And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

Give him what he wants.

What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

I don't care. I want my child!

What I believe
my wife is trying to say is,

we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

Financially, by robbing you of donors...
and politically,

by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

Are you thr*at me?

We all use the tools at our disposal.

You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

Doctor...

you told me to follow my instincts...

and they tell me
not to give in to this criminal.

That was before they took my daughter.

I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

What's up?

You OK?

Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

I have to stop this madness, Eduardo.

But God willing,
we can catch him first.

Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

And there it was.

Negotiate with a t*rror1st while
trying to catch him at the same time.

Hammer, we have calls
originating in Comuna 3,

Manrique, from known
sicario satellite phones.

Do you have a location?

What?

Yes, we're here in Campo Vald?s.

Campo Vald?s.

That's in the central eastern area,
bordered by the Comuna Popular.

Roger that.

Campo Vald?s.

Going into the comunas
without Colombian backup,

that's about the most dangerous
thing you can do.

We're gonna
score a quick goal and then come back out.

All right, all right. All right.

That's how bad
we wanted to catch these guys.

Don't k*ll me, please!

I swear I didn't hear anything!
I'm not going to say anything!

Please, don't k*ll me.

- I'm not--
- Hey! Hey!

- Please, don't k*ll me!
- What?

I'm begging you, please...

You could have at least waited till
I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?

You got blood all over my new shoes.

I don't give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

I'm not.

What about her?

Put a b*llet in her.

What? The baby's not a witness, man.

I don't give a shit.

- Pablo told us to k*ll everyone.
- Yeah, but it's a baby.

She won't say shit in court.

If she grows up and talks?

Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

Why is it so f*cking difficult
for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?

Drop the g*n.

Now!

You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

Let him go!

Let him go!

- Put the g*n down.
- You put yours down.

I don't want to have to k*ll you.

I will.

f*ck.

f*ck!

Hey.

Hey...

So those f*g want to sit and negotiate.

Well...

we have to spend some time in jail, right?

So what the f*ck.

You won, Pablo. They gave in.

But that f*g president has yet
to accept our most important demand

before we turn ourselves in.

Which demand is that?

It's been a while
since we've been up here, right?

Yeah.

We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

What does that have to do with anything?

I know every centimeter
of these mountains.

From here,
we can see anything coming.

And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

We're going to design it...

we're going to build it...

and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

- You want to build a jail?
- Not a jail, cousin.

A castle."

He established a bounty system for k*ll<br/>

<br/>
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.<br/>
- OK--<br/>
<br/>
Sit down. Do it again.<br/>
It's getting better.<br/>
<br/>
We were protecting Elisa<br/>
<br/>
because she could tie Escobar<br/>
to the Palace of Justice...<br/>
<br/>
but by protecting a communist,<br/>
we were traitors.<br/>
<br/>
Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you ready?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Honey, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- You better help us get Escobar.<br/>
- I want him d*ad, too.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?<br/>
<br/>
You clearly don't know<br/>
your country's history in Latin America.<br/>

Wow. Maybe I will.<br/>
<br/>
Just get in the car, OK?<br/>
<br/>
OK, OK, they're on the move.<br/>
<br/>
- Go. Go, go, go.<br/>
<br/>
Should've never brought Connie down here.<br/>
She's not cut out for it.<br/>

- He's got that commie bitch with him.<br/>
- Don't do anything stupid.<br/>

Just keep your head down<br/>
and this'll all be over soon enough.<br/>

up here on the left.<br/>

<br/>
Get out!<br/>
<br/>
- Step away from the vehicle.<br/>
- You following me?<br/>
<br/>
- Move him away.<br/>
- Easy.<br/>
<br/>
- Easy.<br/>
- Back!<br/>
<br/>
- Come on. Move the f*ck back!<br/>
- Get your hands--<br/>
<br/>
- Get your f*cking hands off me!<br/>
- Hey!<br/>
<br/>
- You spying on me?<br/>
- Relax, Murphy!<br/>
<br/>
Who the f*ck were you talking to?<br/>
<br/>
The f*ck is she?<br/>
<br/>
Stand down.<br/>
<br/>
Who were you talking to, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Peña.<br/>
<br/>
I got wife troubles.<br/>
<br/>
- Wife troubles.<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband was clever<br/>
to get them to follow him.<br/>
<br/>
I hope he's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Shit.<br/>
<br/>
Good morning, ladies.<br/>
Where are you headed?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, sir. I'm American.<br/>
I don't speak Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
You speak Spanish?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I asked where you are headed.<br/>
<br/>
- Popayán.<br/>
- Popayán?<br/>
<br/>
Your papers, please.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, documents.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Connie Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
Alba Borraga.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice trip.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
- Be well.<br/>
<br/>
Gracias, señor.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
OK, yes.<br/>
<br/>
OK, you got her to the orphanage.<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
Elisa's fine.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, God.<br/>
No, I'm just glad you're OK.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?<br/>
<br/>
I want you to call me<br/>
every other hour from the road.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, call me every hour.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
I love you, too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud of you. Bye.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I knew Connie was safe,<br/>
I could focus on César Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
At the time, the only thing more dangerous<br/>
than being a Colombian cop<br/>
<br/>
was being a Colombian<br/>
presidential candidate.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria had come out<br/>
in favor of extraditing the narcos<br/>
<br/>
to the United States, and it was in our<br/>
best interest that he win the presidency.<br/>
<br/>
- But to win...<br/>
- Gracias.<br/>
<br/>
...he had to survive until election day.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Señor Gaviria?<br/>
<br/>
Through that door.<br/>
<br/>
- You must be Agent Murphy.<br/>
- Hola.<br/>
<br/>
- Nice to meet you.<br/>
- Pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Eduardo Sandoval,<br/>
head of security of Dr. Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
What can we do for you?<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that our agency<br/>
can offer some resources<br/>
<br/>
to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn't the DEA be out<br/>
chasing tr*ffick or is just my thought?<br/>
<br/>
- I think the two coincide.<br/>
- Agent Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
- Pleasure, sir.<br/>
- The pleasure is mine.<br/>
<br/>
Please, have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Your Secret Service<br/>
has briefed us on security measures.<br/>
<br/>
No open-air speaking engagements,<br/>
different routes home every day.<br/>
<br/>
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán,<br/>
we needed an education on these things.<br/>
<br/>
- Come on.<br/>
- Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
These men will stop at nothing<br/>
to k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm aware of that.<br/>
And we're taking every precaution.<br/>
<br/>
Your government even offers<br/>
the use of an armored Cadillac limousine,<br/>
<br/>
built for your president.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá<br/>
with an American-made t*nk<br/>
<br/>
won't exactly endear us to the voters.<br/>
<br/>
And to be honest...<br/>
we don't know how to respond to that one.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy,<br/>
I'd say thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
And this?<br/>
<br/>
What are we supposed to do with this?<br/>
<br/>
b*llet-proof pants.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that you wear them.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Agent Murphy,<br/>
for your consideration.<br/>
<br/>
And we'll keep in mind your advice.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.<br/>
<br/>
WITH GAVIRIA<br/>
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE<br/>
<br/>
César Gaviria was riding<br/>
a wave of public support<br/>
<br/>
for his stance on extradition.<br/>
This made him a target.<br/>
<br/>
But we had a target of our own:<br/>
José Rodríguez Gacha,<br/>
<br/>
who we tracked to Cartagena<br/>
through one of our informants.<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard of this thing<br/>
called a computer?<br/>
<br/>
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.<br/>
I don't know what it is.<br/>
<br/>
It's a new kind of technology<br/>
that's coming out.<br/>
<br/>
- It's coming out now?<br/>
- Yeah, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, honey.<br/>
<br/>
You look very beautiful today.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, baby. Relax.<br/>
We don't bite.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you need anything else?<br/>
- I want you.<br/>
<br/>
- Nothing more, thank you.<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
I want to f*ck her.<br/>
<br/>
We have more important things<br/>
to worry about right now, my son.<br/>
<br/>
Understood?<br/>
<br/>
Talk to me. What do you know?<br/>
<br/>
Don Gonzalo,<br/>
we have people all over the property.<br/>
<br/>
It's secure.<br/>
<br/>
- We've got a few men in town as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what can you tell me<br/>
about Medellín?<br/>
<br/>
The same, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc<br/>
is out looking for Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
- Here to serve, boss.<br/>
- Keep us safe.<br/>
<br/>
Don Freddy.<br/>
<br/>
Son... a question.<br/>
<br/>
Are we sheep or are we wolves?<br/>
<br/>
- We're wolves.<br/>
- We're wolves! Right.<br/>
<br/>
I like it.<br/>
<br/>
They're in a house outside<br/>
of Cartagena, right here.<br/>
<br/>
Just know there are<br/>
a lot of people guarding him.<br/>
<br/>
Navegante, you've been<br/>
working for Gacha for many years.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure in that time you've<br/>
earned way more than we are giving you.<br/>
<br/>
So tell me,<br/>
why do you want to betray him?<br/>
<br/>
That f*ck's crazy.<br/>
<br/>
He's gonna get us all k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe him one bit.<br/>
<br/>
What do you care<br/>
why he's doing it?<br/>
<br/>
Because we have 23 agents with<br/>
outdated w*apon waiting in Barranquilla.<br/>
<br/>
And he has twice as many men<br/>
with brand new w*apon.<br/>
<br/>
And frankly...<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of sending young men<br/>
to face certain death.<br/>
<br/>
So then we have to be smart.<br/>
<br/>
We have to create a trap.<br/>
<br/>
If we catch him alive,<br/>
he'll give us Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
And the Ochoas.<br/>
<br/>
- The entire cartel.<br/>
- I don't give a f*ck, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
I want him d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't care about death.<br/>
<br/>
He only fears rotting in jail.<br/>
<br/>
- That's the real victory.<br/>
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.<br/>
<br/>
- What's that supposed to mean?<br/>
- What are you risking?<br/>
<br/>
These aren't your men.<br/>
<br/>
You have no family here to lose.<br/>
<br/>
If this goes badly, there will be<br/>
more widows and orphans,<br/>
<br/>
and I'll have to carry that<br/>
on my shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
I trust his information.<br/>
<br/>
And I trust you.<br/>
<br/>
But if this turns out bad...<br/>
it'll be on your conscience.<br/>
<br/>
What do we got?<br/>
<br/>
Routine airport surveillance.<br/>
We tagged Poison.<br/>
<br/>
Who's this guy?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, but if Poison<br/>
showed his face to pick him up,<br/>
<br/>
he must be really important.<br/>
<br/>
Here's your payment, sir.<br/>
<br/>
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain<br/>
on a cargo ship.<br/>
<br/>
From there, our trucks<br/>
will take it to the Basque country.<br/>
<br/>
It's all set up.<br/>
<br/>
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain<br/>
on the first flight.<br/>
<br/>
What's that?<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, you and my cousin<br/>
have an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
The agreement is for this amount.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of bullshit is this?<br/>
<br/>
5,000 kilos or no deal.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is no deal. Who the f*ck<br/>
do you think you're talking to?<br/>
<br/>
Forgive my cousin, sir.<br/>
<br/>
5,000 it is, then.<br/>
<br/>
We shouldn't go.<br/>
<br/>
I want you in the US.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be safe there,<br/>
far from all of this.<br/>
<br/>
- What if something happens--<br/>
- Nothing is going to happen to me.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Please, protect him.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, everything will be fine.<br/>
Come on, I'll walk you.<br/>
<br/>
Bye, Daddy, I love you!<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria's life was on the line...<br/>
<br/>
my wife was with Colombia's<br/>
most wanted fugitive,<br/>
<br/>
and my partner was in Cartagena.<br/>
<br/>
He had his own mission,<br/>
with a group of cops<br/>
<br/>
who had seen their friends and relatives<br/>
die at the hands of Gacha.<br/>
<br/>
Like Trujillo,<br/>
whose father and two brothers, all cops,<br/>
<br/>
had died in g*n battles with the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
As hard as we were going after Gacha,<br/>
the narcos wanted Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
It k*ll me to ask for help<br/>
from this guy.<br/>
<br/>
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish,<br/>
with none of the charm.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello, Suárez.<br/>
- Look who's here.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Gringo.<br/>
<br/>
You don't call, you don't write.<br/>
<br/>
I called your office.<br/>
<br/>
I only speak to Peña.<br/>
<br/>
I need to know who this is.<br/>
<br/>
I need... I need...<br/>
<br/>
I need to know who he is.<br/>
<br/>
""I need to know who he is.""<br/>
<br/>
Don't make me laugh, f*g.<br/>
<br/>
""I need to know who he is.""<br/>
<br/>
The f*ck back! f*ck back.<br/>
<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
- You work for me, assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
- Right? Clear? Is that clear?<br/>
<br/>
You know who he is?<br/>
Gonna tell me? Gonna speak? Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
Suárez knew exactly who<br/>
this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.<br/>
<br/>
- Jesus Christ.<br/>
- Next time you wanna f*ck somebody,<br/>
<br/>
take 'em on a date.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
I have reason to believe<br/>
the Medellín cartel<br/>
<br/>
is planning an imminent attack<br/>
against Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
We have no intel to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should do your job instead<br/>
of spying on other agency personnel.<br/>
<br/>
- What's he talking about?<br/>
- Nothing, Ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
CIA's been so kind<br/>
to give us these documents,<br/>
<br/>
but 90 percent of them<br/>
are too classified for us to read.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get into the White Room.<br/>
<br/>
What's that?<br/>
<br/>
Cut the shit.<br/>
You're gonna give me these files.<br/>
<br/>
You've been reading too many spy novels.<br/>
<br/>
Spy novels...<br/>
Have you read The Spaniard?<br/>
<br/>
Where the hell did you get that?<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am, he has been in the country<br/>
for several days.<br/>
<br/>
He's been escorted<br/>
by one of Pablo's top sicarios.<br/>
<br/>
Let me see this.<br/>
<br/>
I know the CIA has intel on this man.<br/>
<br/>
Now, are you going<br/>
to give me access or not?<br/>
<br/>
Technically, the room isn't white.<br/>
<br/>
It's more of a... g*n.<br/>
<br/>
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?<br/>
- Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
The White Room<br/>
was a top secret repository<br/>
<br/>
for the CIA's deepest,<br/>
darkest secrets.<br/>
<br/>
So secret, in fact, that its<br/>
very existence was never acknowledged.<br/>
<br/>
Sit here.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Schroeder<br/>
will watch you the entire time.<br/>
<br/>
Where are the files?<br/>
<br/>
I feel like he's still too soft.<br/>
<br/>
He'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like we need<br/>
to suspend the operation.<br/>
<br/>
- It's too delicate.<br/>
- You worry too much, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
That's the reason<br/>
your hair is falling out.<br/>
<br/>
- Very funny, f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Keep laughing.<br/>
<br/>
How's our boy doing, Mom?<br/>
<br/>
He's learning,<br/>
with a little tough love.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up, Aunt?<br/>
- What's new?<br/>
<br/>
That's so he can mix<br/>
with the sons of the oligarchs, right?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
- So he can get us some information.<br/>
<br/>
What about these clowns?<br/>
<br/>
Are they treating you right?<br/>
<br/>
More or less.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean ""more or less""?<br/>
We treat you good.<br/>
<br/>
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?<br/>
<br/>
- Some rice?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the family.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,boss.<br/>
<br/>
Can't you do anything?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
While we're at w*r,<br/>
we can't do anything.<br/>
<br/>
This is bullshit.<br/>
People are turning up d*ad every day<br/>
<br/>
and my friends<br/>
think my brothers are responsible.<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk about something else, baby.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
All right,<br/>
let's talk about running away together.<br/>
<br/>
Let's get away while we can.<br/>
<br/>
""Let's get away.""<br/>
Listen to this.<br/>
<br/>
Why would you run away<br/>
with a criminal like me?<br/>
<br/>
And why not?<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was that easy.<br/>
<br/>
- Ah.<br/>
- I can't just leave like that.<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
<br/>
- You say that because of your wife.<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a shit about my wife.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the woman<br/>
in that relationship?<br/>
<br/>
You?<br/>
<br/>
Gacha was always paranoid<br/>
when things were quiet.<br/>
<br/>
And now, he began to wonder<br/>
about Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, doll.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
I'm married, sir.<br/>
<br/>
That's no problem.<br/>
I can make you a widow pretty quick.<br/>
<br/>
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.<br/>
<br/>
Freddy, leave her alone.<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
The Search Bloc is here,<br/>
not in Medellín.<br/>
<br/>
But Navegante said they were over there.<br/>
<br/>
Navegante... Navegante is a liar.<br/>
<br/>
He wouldn't betray you.<br/>
<br/>
Freddy... think, think.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the world has a price.<br/>
<br/>
All right, let's go!<br/>
<br/>
They want w*r, we'll give them w*r!<br/>
<br/>
The Spaniard was a name<br/>
that got everyone's attention.<br/>
<br/>
He was a member of Eta.<br/>
<br/>
Never heard of 'em?<br/>
<br/>
They made b*mb-making<br/>
a g*dd*mn art form.<br/>
<br/>
They were a group of supposed<br/>
freedom fighters from the Basque country,<br/>
<br/>
trying to secede from Spain.<br/>
<br/>
Their specialty was<br/>
targeted assassinations of public figures.<br/>
<br/>
Eta was responsible for the assassination<br/>
of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco,<br/>
<br/>
returning home from Christmas Mass...<br/>
<br/>
and a remote-controlled car b*mb that<br/>
k*ll Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.<br/>
<br/>
The man behind those b*mb?<br/>
You guessed it... the Spaniard.<br/>
<br/>
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez,<br/>
a celebrity now, for hire.<br/>
<br/>
Expensive, but the best.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.<br/>
<br/>
That was Pablo's plan,<br/>
to blow up Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
The question was,<br/>
where, when and how?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your concern,<br/>
Madam Ambassador,<br/>
<br/>
but canceling our campaign travel<br/>
is not an option.<br/>
<br/>
Well, given the new information<br/>
that Agent Murphy has uncovered,<br/>
<br/>
I hope you'll reconsider.<br/>
<br/>
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá,<br/>
and a dozen other cities.<br/>
<br/>
You are a target in every one.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and... we've done everything<br/>
your Secret Service<br/>
<br/>
and Spain's Civil Guard<br/>
have recommended.<br/>
<br/>
We also have b*mb-sniffing dogs<br/>
at every campaign stop, so...<br/>
<br/>
I think we're good.<br/>
<br/>
You think the Spaniard<br/>
doesn't know that?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know.<br/>
<br/>
But tell me, Agent Murphy,<br/>
how do you expect him to win the election<br/>
<br/>
if he hides like a scared rabbit<br/>
behind all this v*olence?<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, how?<br/>
<br/>
How do you expect him to win<br/>
if he's d*ad?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not telling your wife<br/>
you died on my watch.<br/>
<br/>
This is not your watch, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Agent Murphy...<br/>
but Eduardo's right.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take my chances.<br/>
<br/>
His name is Steve Murphy. He's DEA.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you'll pay for this information.<br/>
<br/>
Suárez is talking to the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
You know what you have to do.<br/>
<br/>
He got away.<br/>
<br/>
They k*ll the g*dd*mn maid.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel!<br/>
<br/>
Colonel...<br/>
<br/>
They called from the road block.<br/>
<br/>
They have a car stopped<br/>
and they're saying the driver's a senator.<br/>
<br/>
- Does he have his identification?<br/>
- Everything checks out.<br/>
<br/>
So what's the problem?<br/>
<br/>
They found a machine g*n in the trunk.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Look at my credentials.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't know this Gacha person<br/>
you're referring to.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you have a g*n in the trunk?<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician<br/>
in this country carries a w*apon?<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
- It's my bodyguard's.<br/>
- Where's your bodyguard?<br/>
<br/>
You're alone in the car, right?<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me, officers...<br/>
<br/>
if you don't let me go immediately,<br/>
you're going to regret it.<br/>
<br/>
Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Give us a moment.<br/>
- Go on.<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe him.<br/>
<br/>
I don't either.<br/>
<br/>
He could have bought his credentials.<br/>
<br/>
What if it turns out he is a senator?<br/>
<br/>
We'll pay for that.<br/>
<br/>
I can't run that risk.<br/>
<br/>
It's true.<br/>
<br/>
- You can't.<br/>
<br/>
The next one...<br/>
goes in your head!<br/>
<br/>
- All right, all right!<br/>
- Talk, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
I'll talk, I'll talk!<br/>
<br/>
I love you, my sweetheart.<br/>
I love you.<br/>
<br/>
You have a guest.<br/>
It's Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
- Don Pablo.<br/>
- This is your house?<br/>
<br/>
- Your family?<br/>
- Yes, sir. Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me about them.<br/>
<br/>
This is my daughter Marcela.<br/>
<br/>
- Look at what a cute baby.<br/>
<br/>
- How proud you must be.<br/>
- Of course I am.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, they will have the money<br/>
to buy everything they want, Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot, boss.<br/>
<br/>
- May I please have a glass of water?<br/>
- Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- What about you?<br/>
- Good, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- How have you been?<br/>
- Good, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Guys.<br/>
<br/>
All right, Jaime.<br/>
<br/>
This is for you to wear<br/>
during your mission.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Ma'am.<br/>
Very kind.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is so beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be very careful,<br/>
and get by unnoticed.<br/>
<br/>
For sure, sir.<br/>
I'm ready to do what you're asking.<br/>
<br/>
All right, then, son.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down.<br/>
<br/>
These guys are going to give you<br/>
very specific instructions.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding<br/>
the plane that is leaving for Cali.<br/>
<br/>
We want you to record a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
It's very simple,<br/>
nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
- How are you feeling?<br/>
- I'm... I'm very happy.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for the opportunity,<br/>
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Really, for me,<br/>
it's an honor to work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Don't mention it.<br/>
<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
Come here, give me a hug.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Ma'am, have a good night.<br/>
- Take care.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
See you later, boys.<br/>
<br/>
- Take care.<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
My love, look!<br/>
<br/>
- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?<br/>
- It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?<br/>
<br/>
You know what?<br/>
We're going to get ahead.<br/>
<br/>
You, me and the baby<br/>
are going to get ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, my love.<br/>
<br/>
- Look at this.<br/>
- Let's go try it on.<br/>
<br/>
I have some news about Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
They're going to k*ll him<br/>
on the way to Cali.<br/>
<br/>
Did you say Cali?<br/>
Hey, can I get a translate in here?<br/>
<br/>
Suárez, OK.<br/>
<br/>
I can translate.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a moment.<br/>
Someone is at the door.<br/>
<br/>
""Tu puerta""?<br/>
<br/>
- ""Door.""<br/>
- Door.<br/>
<br/>
Suárez! Suárez.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Suárez!<br/>
<br/>
Talk to me, you bastard.<br/>
Suárez, hello?<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Hel--<br/>
<br/>
- I want that call.<br/>
- Right away, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo and his men<br/>
arrived in Tolu to k*ll Gacha.<br/>
<br/>
And Peña still hoped<br/>
he could be taken alive.<br/>
<br/>
It was her fault, Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Are you still thinking about that?<br/>
Let it go, son.<br/>
<br/>
All she had to do was say yes<br/>
and I wouldn't have had to sh**t her!<br/>
<br/>
Be a man!<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch!<br/>
They found us!<br/>
<br/>
- Come on, son!<br/>
<br/>
- Sir, are you OK?<br/>
- I'm fine. I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
- He's trying to get away!<br/>
- He won't get away.<br/>
<br/>
Get me a radio, quick!<br/>
<br/>
Correal, bring a radio!<br/>
Correal! A radio!<br/>
<br/>
Dad, let's go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!<br/>
<br/>
Hurry!<br/>
<br/>
Stop!<br/>
<br/>
Peña!<br/>
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!<br/>
<br/>
What did I tell you?<br/>
We got out OK.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm scared.<br/>
- Scared of what?<br/>
<br/>
You're a wolf, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am a wolf.<br/>
<br/>
It's a helicopter! It's a<br/>
helicopter! They're going to k*ll us!<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is going to k*ll us!<br/>
Don't talk like that!<br/>
<br/>
Take this. Take it!<br/>
<br/>
- I have a Chevy in sight.<br/>
- Stop him!<br/>
<br/>
Don't let him get away!<br/>
Try and disable the vehicle!<br/>
<br/>
No good.<br/>
We're going in again.<br/>
<br/>
Stop him!<br/>
Do whatever you have to do!<br/>
<br/>
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.<br/>
- No, no. Never, son, never!<br/>
<br/>
Breathe! Breathe!<br/>
<br/>
Do you want this, assh*le?<br/>
<br/>
- Do you want this?<br/>
<br/>
We're taking f*re!<br/>
<br/>
We'll circle around<br/>
and approach from another direction.<br/>
<br/>
You don't need to worry about anything,<br/>
my son. Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Don't take any chances!<br/>
We can't afford to lose him!<br/>
<br/>
Copy.<br/>
<br/>
Look. Look outside. Look outside!<br/>
<br/>
What's happening?<br/>
Peña, what's happening?<br/>
<br/>
We stopped him.<br/>
He's not moving.<br/>
<br/>
Freddy. Freddy?<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, Freddy.<br/>
<br/>
Freddy?<br/>
<br/>
Freddy?<br/>
<br/>
Son!<br/>
<br/>
You're a wolf. You're a wolf.<br/>
<br/>
assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
assh*le! Hey, assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!<br/>
<br/>
- Hey, assh*le! What are you gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
What are you gonna do?<br/>
assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
What are you gonna do?!<br/>
assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
He's out of b*ll*ts.<br/>
We can take him alive.<br/>
<br/>
It's your call.<br/>
<br/>
What are you gonna do?!<br/>
assh*le!<br/>
<br/>
Give him lead.<br/>
<br/>
Affirmative. Maintain positions<br/>
and patrol the area again. Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Are you OK?<br/>
<br/>
I'll sleep tonight.<br/>
<br/>
This was the first successful<br/>
major operation by the Search Bloc.<br/>
<br/>
It signaled to the country<br/>
and to the world<br/>
<br/>
that the fight against the narcos<br/>
had moved to a new level.<br/>
<br/>
According to recent polls,<br/>
we're doing well.<br/>
<br/>
We're gaining points<br/>
in six districts within Cali.<br/>
<br/>
That's important,<br/>
because it means we could pull ahead.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.<br/>
- I know.<br/>
<br/>
The last time,<br/>
we fell five points in one day.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes. We--<br/>
- Dr. Gaviria!<br/>
<br/>
Stop him!<br/>
Sir, we can't let you through!<br/>
<br/>
Relax. Let him through.<br/>
<br/>
- Agent Murphy.<br/>
- What are you doing here?<br/>
<br/>
- No, no. He can't go, no.<br/>
- What?<br/>
<br/>
There's gonna be a b*mb waiting.<br/>
He goes, he dies.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br/>
What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
This is your job, your call.<br/>
But I know something's gonna go down.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have proof?<br/>
<br/>
- I got my gut.<br/>
<br/>
You got your gut.<br/>
<br/>
- What if you're wrong?<br/>
- I hope to God I am.<br/>
<br/>
What if I'm right?<br/>
<br/>
You nervous?<br/>
<br/>
A little bit, but I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
Wait here, wait here.<br/>
<br/>
You know what you have to do?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, you have to record<br/>
the entire conversation. Don't forget.<br/>
<br/>
- No, sir.<br/>
- Have a nice flight.<br/>
<br/>
Aren't you coming with me?<br/>
<br/>
No, the boss just told me<br/>
to bring you here.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, but don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow,<br/>
I'll come and meet you there.<br/>
<br/>
- All right, then.<br/>
- All right. Don't be nervous.<br/>
<br/>
You'll see how fun it is to fly.<br/>
<br/>
All right?<br/>
<br/>
Go on. The line is right there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, then.<br/>
<br/>
It's up to you, Eduardo.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you decide, I'll do.<br/>
<br/>
Avianca announces the departure<br/>
of Flight 203 to Cali,<br/>
<br/>
now boarding at Gate 6.<br/>
<br/>
I'll follow your gut this time.<br/>
<br/>
I'll organize the exit.<br/>
You guys stay with him.<br/>
<br/>
Well... it seems like you and I<br/>
are not the only ones afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Put on your seatbelt, please.</div>]","Stop!

OK!

- How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

Your ID, please.

Certainly.

Give me that.

How many times have I told you
not to throw the ball over there?

Are you trying
to scare your sister or what?

- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.

Don't you see she's just a baby?

You yourself were a baby
not too long ago.

Yes, Dad.

- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.

Never say that.

We are a family and we have
to look out for each other, always.

- You hear me?

Hello.

Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.

- Yes, go on. How many?
- Two.

Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?

Officers. You know Poison.

- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?

- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.

All right.

What were you talking about?

Just business.

I want to be a businessman like you.

Pablo's path was total w*r.

He established a bounty system for k*ll
cops and over 200 were slaughtered.

The police had to build a special morgue
just to hold the bodies.

The cops,
they took vengeance.

My name is Alba Borraga,
born 1962 in Popayán.

Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.

I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

OK, try it again and look at me.

I've already done it 17 times.

You got me and my wife into this.

Now sit down and do it again
until you get it right.

My name is Alba Borraga,
born 1962 in Popayán.

Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.

I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

What if they ask me
a question about chemistry?

- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK--

Sit down. Do it again.
It's getting better.

We were protecting Elisa

because she could tie Escobar
to the Palace of Justice...

but by protecting a communist,
we were traitors.

Go figure.

Let's go.

- Are you ready?
- Yes.

Honey, thank you.

- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him d*ad, too.

Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?

You clearly don't know
your country's history in Latin America.

- Sorry, I didn't hear that--
- Honey, mellow out, OK?

Steve, I know you're mad,
but this is the right thing to do.

The right thing to do? I didn't have
a choice in the matter, did I?

This is the only choice.

You should think about
going back to Miami.

They're in their car. Hold on.

Wow. Maybe I will.

Just get in the car, OK?

OK, OK, they're on the move.

- Go. Go, go, go.

Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.

- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.

Just keep your head down
and this'll all be over soon enough.

We're gonna cut him off
up here on the left.

Get out of the car, Murphy!

Get out!

- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?

- Move him away.
- Easy.

- Easy.
- Back!

- Come on. Move the f*ck back!
- Get your hands--

- Get your f*cking hands off me!
- Hey!

- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!

Who the f*ck were you talking to?

The f*ck is she?

Stand down.

Who were you talking to, huh?

Peña.

I got wife troubles.

- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.

Your husband was clever
to get them to follow him.

I hope he's OK.

Shit.

Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?

I'm sorry, sir. I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.

You speak Spanish?

Yes.

I asked where you are headed.

- Popayán.
- Popayán?

Your papers, please.

Uh, documents.

Ms. Connie Murphy.

Alba Borraga.

Have a nice trip.

- Thank you.
- Be well.

Gracias, señor.

Hello?

OK, yes.

OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.

Elisa's fine.

Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.

Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?

I want you to call me
every other hour from the road.

Actually, call me every hour.

Yeah. Yeah, I know.

I love you, too.

I'm proud of you. Bye.

Now that I knew Connie was safe,
I could focus on César Gaviria.

At the time, the only thing more dangerous
than being a Colombian cop

was being a Colombian
presidential candidate.

Mm-hm.

Gaviria had come out
in favor of extraditing the narcos

to the United States, and it was in our
best interest that he win the presidency.

- But to win...
- Gracias.

...he had to survive until election day.

Uh, Señor Gaviria?

Through that door.

- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.

- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

I'm Eduardo Sandoval,
head of security of Dr. Gaviria.

What can we do for you?

I'm hoping that our agency
can offer some resources

to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.

Shouldn't the DEA be out
chasing tr*ffick or is just my thought?

- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.

- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.

Please, have a seat.

Your Secret Service
has briefed us on security measures.

No open-air speaking engagements,
different routes home every day.

As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán,
we needed an education on these things.

- Come on.
- Exactly.

These men will stop at nothing
to k*ll you.

I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.

Your government even offers
the use of an armored Cadillac limousine,

built for your president.

The thing is that driving around in Bogotá
with an American-made t*nk

won't exactly endear us to the voters.

And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.

Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy,
I'd say thank you.

Well, thank you.

And this?

What are we supposed to do with this?

b*llet-proof pants.

I suggest that you wear them.

Thank you, Agent Murphy,
for your consideration.

And we'll keep in mind your advice.

Thank you for your time.

WITH GAVIRIA
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE

César Gaviria was riding
a wave of public support

for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.

But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha,

who we tracked to Cartagena
through one of our informants.

Have you heard of this thing
called a computer?

Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.

It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.

Hey, honey.

You look very beautiful today.

Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite.

- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.

- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

I want to f*ck her.

We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

Understood?

Talk to me. What do you know?

Don Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

It's secure.

- We've got a few men in town as well.

Now, what can you tell me
about Medellín?

The same, boss.

Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

Thank you, Navegante.

- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.

Don Freddy.

Son... a question.

Are we sheep or are we wolves?

- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

I like it.

They're in a house outside
of Cartagena, right here.

Just know there are
a lot of people guarding him.

Navegante, you've been
working for Gacha for many years.

I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

That f*ck's crazy.

He's gonna get us all k*ll.

I don't believe him one bit.

What do you care
why he's doing it?

Because we have 23 agents with
outdated w*apon waiting in Barranquilla.

And he has twice as many men
with brand new w*apon.

And frankly...

I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

So then we have to be smart.

We have to create a trap.

If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

And the Ochoas.

- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a f*ck, Javier.

I want him d*ad.

He doesn't care about death.

He only fears rotting in jail.

- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

These aren't your men.

You have no family here to lose.

If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

and I'll have to carry that
on my shoulders.

Well...

I trust his information.

And I trust you.

But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.

What do we got?

Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.

Who's this guy?

I don't know, but if Poison
showed his face to pick him up,

he must be really important.

Here's your payment, sir.

It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

It's all set up.

5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain
on the first flight.

What's that?

As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

The agreement is for this amount.

What kind of bullshit is this?

5,000 kilos or no deal.

Then there is no deal. Who the f*ck
do you think you're talking to?

Forgive my cousin, sir.

5,000 it is, then.

We shouldn't go.

I want you in the US.

You'll be safe there,
far from all of this.

- What if something happens--
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

Let's go.

Please, protect him.

Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.

Bye, Daddy, I love you!

Gaviria's life was on the line...

my wife was with Colombia's
most wanted fugitive,

and my partner was in Cartagena.

He had his own mission,
with a group of cops

who had seen their friends and relatives
die at the hands of Gacha.

Like Trujillo,
whose father and two brothers, all cops,

had died in g*n battles with the cartel.

As hard as we were going after Gacha,
the narcos wanted Gaviria.

It k*ll me to ask for help
from this guy.

Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish,
with none of the charm.

- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.

The Golden Gringo.

You don't call, you don't write.

I called your office.

I only speak to Peña.

I need to know who this is.

I need... I need...

I need to know who he is.

""I need to know who he is.""

Don't make me laugh, f*g.

""I need to know who he is.""

The f*ck back! f*ck back.

OK.

- You work for me, assh*le!

- Right? Clear? Is that clear?

You know who he is?
Gonna tell me? Gonna speak? Yeah...

Suárez knew exactly who
this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.

- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna f*ck somebody,

take 'em on a date.

What's going on?

I have reason to believe
the Medellín cartel

is planning an imminent attack
against Gaviria.

We have no intel to that effect.

Maybe you should do your job instead
of spying on other agency personnel.

- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.

CIA's been so kind
to give us these documents,

but 90 percent of them
are too classified for us to read.

I need to get into the White Room.

What's that?

Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.

You've been reading too many spy novels.

Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?

Where the hell did you get that?

Ma'am, he has been in the country
for several days.

He's been escorted
by one of Pablo's top sicarios.

Let me see this.

I know the CIA has intel on this man.

Now, are you going
to give me access or not?

Technically, the room isn't white.

It's more of a... g*n.

- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.

The White Room
was a top secret repository

for the CIA's deepest,
darkest secrets.

So secret, in fact, that its
very existence was never acknowledged.

Sit here.

Agent Schroeder
will watch you the entire time.

Where are the files?

I feel like he's still too soft.

He'll be fine.

I don't know, Pablo.

I feel like we need
to suspend the operation.

- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.

That's the reason
your hair is falling out.

- Very funny, f*ck.

Keep laughing.

How's our boy doing, Mom?

He's learning,
with a little tough love.

- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?

That's so he can mix
with the sons of the oligarchs, right?

- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.

What about these clowns?

Are they treating you right?

More or less.

What do you mean ""more or less""?
We treat you good.

Are we going to eat, Gustavo?

- Some rice?
- Yes.

Thank you.

Jaime.

Welcome to the family.

Thank you,boss.

Can't you do anything?

No.

While we're at w*r,
we can't do anything.

This is bullshit.
People are turning up d*ad every day

and my friends
think my brothers are responsible.

Let's talk about something else, baby.

Yes.

All right,
let's talk about running away together.

Let's get away while we can.

""Let's get away.""
Listen to this.

Why would you run away
with a criminal like me?

And why not?

I wish it was that easy.

- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.

I know.

- You say that because of your wife.

I don't give a shit about my wife.

I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.

Who is the woman
in that relationship?

You?

Gacha was always paranoid
when things were quiet.

And now, he began to wonder
about Navegante.

Hey, doll.

What are you doing?

I'm married, sir.

That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.

Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.

What's up?

The Search Bloc is here,
not in Medellín.

But Navegante said they were over there.

Navegante... Navegante is a liar.

He wouldn't betray you.

Freddy... think, think.

Everyone in the world has a price.

All right, let's go!

They want w*r, we'll give them w*r!

The Spaniard was a name
that got everyone's attention.

He was a member of Eta.

Never heard of 'em?

They made b*mb-making
a g*dd*mn art form.

They were a group of supposed
freedom fighters from the Basque country,

trying to secede from Spain.

Their specialty was
targeted assassinations of public figures.

Eta was responsible for the assassination
of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco,

returning home from Christmas Mass...

and a remote-controlled car b*mb that
k*ll Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.

The man behind those b*mb?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.

Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez,
a celebrity now, for hire.

Expensive, but the best.

'Cause Pablo only hires the best.

That was Pablo's plan,
to blow up Gaviria.

The question was,
where, when and how?

I appreciate your concern,
Madam Ambassador,

but canceling our campaign travel
is not an option.

Well, given the new information
that Agent Murphy has uncovered,

I hope you'll reconsider.

He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá,
and a dozen other cities.

You are a target in every one.

Yes, and... we've done everything
your Secret Service

and Spain's Civil Guard
have recommended.

We also have b*mb-sniffing dogs
at every campaign stop, so...

I think we're good.

You think the Spaniard
doesn't know that?

Yes, I know.

But tell me, Agent Murphy,
how do you expect him to win the election

if he hides like a scared rabbit
behind all this v*olence?

Tell me, how?

How do you expect him to win
if he's d*ad?

I'm not telling your wife
you died on my watch.

This is not your watch, OK?

Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.

I'll take my chances.

His name is Steve Murphy. He's DEA.

I hope you'll pay for this information.

Suárez is talking to the DEA.

You know what you have to do.

He got away.

They k*ll the g*dd*mn maid.

Colonel!

Colonel...

They called from the road block.

They have a car stopped
and they're saying the driver's a senator.

- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.

So what's the problem?

They found a machine g*n in the trunk.

Let's go.

Look at my credentials.

No, I don't know this Gacha person
you're referring to.

Why do you have a g*n in the trunk?

Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician
in this country carries a w*apon?

Please.

- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?

You're alone in the car, right?

Listen to me, officers...

if you don't let me go immediately,
you're going to regret it.

Uh-huh.

Thank you.

- Give us a moment.
- Go on.

I don't believe him.

I don't either.

He could have bought his credentials.

What if it turns out he is a senator?

We'll pay for that.

I can't run that risk.

It's true.

- You can't.

The next one...
goes in your head!

- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!

I'll talk, I'll talk!

I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.

You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.

Hey, Jaime.

- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?

- Your family?
- Yes, sir. Welcome.

Tell me about them.

This is my daughter Marcela.

- Look at what a cute baby.

- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.

Of course.

Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

Thanks a lot, boss.

- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.

Thank you.

- What about you?
- Good, sir.

- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

Guys.

All right, Jaime.

This is for you to wear
during your mission.

Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.

Seriously, Pablo?

Thank you very much.

Everything is so beautiful.

You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.

All right, then, son.

Sit down.

These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

Tomorrow morning, you're boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

We want you to record a conversation.

It's very simple,
nothing to worry about.

All right.

- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm very happy.

Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

Really, for me,
it's an honor to work for you.

Thank you very much.

Don't mention it.

OK.

Come here, give me a hug.

Thank you, Don Pablo.

Thank you.

- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.

Thank you very much.

See you later, boys.

- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

My love, look!

- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?

You know what?
We're going to get ahead.

You, me and the baby
are going to get ahead.

Thank you, my love.

- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.

I have some news about Gaviria.

They're going to k*ll him
on the way to Cali.

Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?

Suárez, OK.

I can translate.

Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.

""Tu puerta""?

- ""Door.""
- Door.

Suárez! Suárez.

Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.

Suárez!

Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?

Hello?

Hel--

- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.

Carrillo and his men
arrived in Tolu to k*ll Gacha.

And Peña still hoped
he could be taken alive.

It was her fault, Dad.

Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

All she had to do was say yes
and I wouldn't have had to sh**t her!

Be a man!

Son of a bitch!
They found us!

- Come on, son!

- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.

Get me a radio, quick!

Correal, bring a radio!
Correal! A radio!

Dad, let's go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!

Hurry!

Stop!

Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!

What did I tell you?
We got out OK.

- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?

You're a wolf, right?

Yes, I am a wolf.

It's a helicopter! It's a
helicopter! They're going to k*ll us!

Nobody is going to k*ll us!
Don't talk like that!

Take this. Take it!

- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!

Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!

No good.
We're going in again.

Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!

- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no. Never, son, never!

Breathe! Breathe!

Do you want this, assh*le?

- Do you want this?

We're taking f*re!

We'll circle around
and approach from another direction.

You don't need to worry about anything,
my son. Nothing.

Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!

Copy.

Look. Look outside. Look outside!

What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?

We stopped him.
He's not moving.

Freddy. Freddy?

Let's go, Freddy.

Freddy?

Freddy?

Son!

You're a wolf. You're a wolf.

assh*le!

assh*le! Hey, assh*le!

Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!

- Hey, assh*le! What are you gonna do?

What are you gonna do?
assh*le!

What are you gonna do?!
assh*le!

He's out of b*ll*ts.
We can take him alive.

It's your call.

What are you gonna do?!
assh*le!

Give him lead.

Affirmative. Maintain positions
and patrol the area again. Very good.

Are you OK?

I'll sleep tonight.

This was the first successful
major operation by the Search Bloc.

It signaled to the country
and to the world

that the fight against the narcos
had moved to a new level.

According to recent polls,
we're doing well.

We're gaining points
in six districts within Cali.

That's important,
because it means we could pull ahead.

- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.

The last time,
we fell five points in one day.

- Yes. We--
- Dr. Gaviria!

Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!

Relax. Let him through.

- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?

- No, no. He can't go, no.
- What?

There's gonna be a b*mb waiting.
He goes, he dies.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.

Do you have proof?

- I got my gut.

You got your gut.

- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.

What if I'm right?

You nervous?

A little bit, but I'm fine.

Wait here, wait here.

You know what you have to do?

Yes, sir.

Remember, you have to record
the entire conversation. Don't forget.

- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.

Aren't you coming with me?

No, the boss just told me
to bring you here.

Hey, but don't worry.

Tomorrow,
I'll come and meet you there.

- All right, then.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

You'll see how fun it is to fly.

All right?

Go on. The line is right there.

Good luck, then.

It's up to you, Eduardo.

Whatever you decide, I'll do.

Avianca announces the departure
of Flight 203 to Cali,

now boarding at Gate 6.

I'll follow your gut this time.

I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.

Well... it seems like you and I
are not the only ones afraid.

She's the only witness we got that<br/>
can tie Escobar to the palace m*ssacre.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to bring her in when<br/>
she gets turned over to the Colombians<br/>
<br/>
and she gets disappeared.<br/>
Are you ready for that?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
So what's our options,<br/>
since we have none?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we keep her in hiding<br/>
until things cool down,<br/>
<br/>
and get her immunity<br/>
in exchange for her testimony...<br/>
<br/>
Are you gonna get us immunity?<br/>
<br/>
We are going to jail<br/>
if we get caught with this woman.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the next time your wife decides<br/>
to bring home a human hand grenade,<br/>
<br/>
how about she hands it to you?<br/>
<br/>
Are you f*cking her?<br/>
<br/>
Sleep with a communist?<br/>
<br/>
That would be downright un-American.<br/>
<br/>
Any intel to support the DEA theory<br/>
<br/>
that Escobar is behind<br/>
the Palace of Justice siege?<br/>
<br/>
No, ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
Agent Peña claims to have an informant<br/>
that can testify to that effect,<br/>
<br/>
but he hasn't brought him forward.<br/>
<br/>
In my book,<br/>
there's only two of them that know that.<br/>
<br/>
And one of them is Elisa Alvaro,<br/>
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.<br/>
<br/>
The other one is Ernesto Sobrino,<br/>
<br/>
a radical priest who gave shelter<br/>
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos comuna.<br/>
<br/>
Is one of these people your informant?<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, this is...<br/>
unofficial wiretap information.<br/>
<br/>
We, uh, intercepted<br/>
a discussion between narcos.<br/>
<br/>
What? Which narcos?<br/>
<br/>
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.<br/>
- We're almost certain.<br/>
<br/>
It was, uh...<br/>
It was hard to tell.<br/>
<br/>
The... connection was bad.<br/>
They were calling from Panama.<br/>
<br/>
- Panama?<br/>
- They know Galán's gonna win<br/>
<br/>
and they know<br/>
that he'll support extradition,<br/>
<br/>
and they're not gonna sit around<br/>
and await being sent back to the US.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega<br/>
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,<br/>
<br/>
and possibly shipping points<br/>
for their cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
They're moving<br/>
their drug operations to Panama?<br/>
<br/>
That's horseshit, Peña.<br/>
Excuse me, Ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, you're saying Escobar's<br/>
in bed with left-wing communists.<br/>
<br/>
Now you're saying<br/>
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.<br/>
<br/>
You can't have it both ways, son.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us<br/>
fight communism all over Latin America<br/>
<br/>
for the last two decades.<br/>
<br/>
I take great offense at any attempt<br/>
by the DEA to smear his good name.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't help but laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Right wing, left wing...<br/>
<br/>
For Manuel Noriega,<br/>
it was all about the money.<br/>
<br/>
When Bush was head of the CIA,<br/>
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater<br/>
<br/>
so the US would ignore the fact that he<br/>
was heavily involved as a drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
When Noriega realized he could<br/>
make even more money shipping his drugs<br/>
<br/>
by siding with communists,<br/>
he switched teams.<br/>
<br/>
So, we invaded Panama,<br/>
and arrested ""Old Pineapple Face.""<br/>
<br/>
But, that was later.<br/>
<br/>
For now, the trusted friend and ally<br/>
was a right-wing CIA asset<br/>
<br/>
who was taking money from Bush...<br/>
and right from the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian<br/>
Supreme Court to fight extradition.<br/>
<br/>
And now, he was offering<br/>
to pay off Colombia's national debt<br/>
<br/>
in exchange for a truce.<br/>
<br/>
Guess he missed home.<br/>
<br/>
Look at this<br/>
shit. We are spending millions of dollars,<br/>
<br/>
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, the problem isn't the food,<br/>
the problem is Noriega.<br/>
<br/>
First chance he gets,<br/>
he'll sell us to the Americans.<br/>
<br/>
You guys stay calm.<br/>
<br/>
Once we reach an agreement with the<br/>
government, we'll be back in our homeland.<br/>
<br/>
Pay the Colombian<br/>
national debt for amnesty?<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather go live in Spain.<br/>
<br/>
I say we go back and fight.<br/>
<br/>
No, sir, none of that.<br/>
w*r is bad for business.<br/>
<br/>
We will negotiate with them<br/>
as Pablo agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Gustavo,<br/>
none of this would've happened<br/>
<br/>
if he hadn't started<br/>
k*ll politicians and judges.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to sit here<br/>
and cry over spilled milk?<br/>
<br/>
You know something, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I think you k*ll these men<br/>
because they won't let you in their club.<br/>
<br/>
You better watch your mouth, assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
The Colombian government<br/>
has refused our amnesty offer.<br/>
<br/>
Get used to the food, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
It's not safe to go back home.<br/>
<br/>
They've rejected our amnesty deal.<br/>
<br/>
We may have to stay.<br/>
<br/>
I hate this place.<br/>
<br/>
We can go someplace else.<br/>
<br/>
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
In Switzerland,<br/>
we are nobody, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
What good is having all the money<br/>
in the world if you can't go home?<br/>
<br/>
If we go back...<br/>
I'm going to have to fight.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever is necessary,<br/>
my love.<br/>
<br/>
So, there it was.<br/>
<br/>
The decision that would<br/>
change Colombia forever.<br/>
<br/>
You're way ahead in the polls.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion,<br/>
the outcome is decided.<br/>
<br/>
My question is... why do you<br/>
keep getting involved with the narcos?<br/>
<br/>
I want a country at peace.<br/>
<br/>
And if I don't do it, who will?<br/>
<br/>
You're backing them into a corner.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wearing a vest.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...<br/>
<br/>
isn't enough to ensure<br/>
that you have a future.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, my friend.<br/>
There will be a future.<br/>
<br/>
Luis Carlos Galán<br/>
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th,<br/>
<br/>
against the advice<br/>
of his campaign manager, César Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
The b*ll*ts entered just below<br/>
his vest and he was d*ad within minutes.<br/>
<br/>
For a brief shining moment,<br/>
there was hope...<br/>
<br/>
extinguished by the pull<br/>
of an assassin's trigger.<br/>
<br/>
To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the<br/>
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...<br/>
<br/>
and in the cities, thousands took<br/>
to the streets in a march of the silent,<br/>
<br/>
a mute protest<br/>
against the v*olence of the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
With Galán's m*rder... came the end<br/>
of hope for a peaceful future.<br/>
<br/>
Let's speak clearly, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Galán's d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
You had him k*ll,<br/>
didn't you?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't tell us shit,<br/>
and you k*ll him, you son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
- I want to go home, Fabio.<br/>
- Home?<br/>
<br/>
Why are we going home?<br/>
So they can capture us?<br/>
<br/>
All this shit you talk about partnership,<br/>
and then you do this on your own? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Galán was the only thr*at.<br/>
<br/>
There is no one left to challenge us.<br/>
<br/>
And you know why, Fabio.<br/>
<br/>
Because no one<br/>
has the balls that we have.<br/>
<br/>
Going home.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was right.<br/>
<br/>
Who would have the balls<br/>
to fill Galán's shoes?<br/>
<br/>
...that unique honesty.<br/>
<br/>
As the people now rise<br/>
and call for justice,<br/>
<br/>
I pray to God<br/>
that this sacrifice will serve at last...<br/>
<br/>
as motivation for society<br/>
to react and bond...<br/>
<br/>
to support the government...<br/>
and institutions...<br/>
<br/>
while also demanding<br/>
a more effective leadership,<br/>
<br/>
one undeterred by the hitmen,<br/>
the hijackings,<br/>
<br/>
or any other manifestations of v*olence.<br/>
<br/>
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,<br/>
<br/>
will be remembered<br/>
for awakening the Colombian people<br/>
<br/>
to the danger of the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
The assassin's b*ll*ts...<br/>
will not stop what my father began.<br/>
<br/>
As he fell,<br/>
another rises in his place.<br/>
<br/>
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...<br/>
<br/>
in the name of the people of Colombia,<br/>
and my family...<br/>
<br/>
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,<br/>
and that he can count on our support...<br/>
<br/>
to become the president<br/>
Colombia wants and needs.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!<br/>
<br/>
Dr. César Gaviria...<br/>
the new hope of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
If he took Galán's position on<br/>
extradition, the narcos would declare w*r.<br/>
<br/>
If he didn't,<br/>
the country would become a narco state.<br/>
<br/>
Phone!<br/>
<br/>
Let it go to the answering machine.<br/>
<br/>
The machine's full.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it would stop ringing.<br/>
<br/>
It's your friends.<br/>
They're calling to offer support.<br/>
<br/>
Or opinions about what I should do.<br/>
<br/>
Why can't you run<br/>
without backing extradition?<br/>
<br/>
- I wrote those speeches.<br/>
- Yes...<br/>
<br/>
but do you even believe in them?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what I believe.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want the narcos having free reign.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't want the United States<br/>
involved in our affairs.<br/>
<br/>
So say nothing.<br/>
<br/>
That's the best way to stay alive.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.<br/>
<br/>
We're going home!<br/>
<br/>
- How are you? Hm?<br/>
- Fine, my love.<br/>
<br/>
What about you?<br/>
<br/>
Give me one.<br/>
<br/>
Margarita, right?<br/>
<br/>
Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
- Son of a bitch, that's good.<br/>
- Right?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
Listen, I've got a question for you.<br/>
<br/>
Why are we going back?<br/>
<br/>
We're walking into a world of shit.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Spain's too far away<br/>
to protect our interests.<br/>
<br/>
We have a better chance<br/>
of influencing Pablo at home.<br/>
<br/>
We need to be close by.<br/>
Relax.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you get it?<br/>
<br/>
He's only comfortable at w*r.<br/>
<br/>
He's taking us to the slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
How's business?<br/>
<br/>
f*cking Noriega is charging us a fortune,<br/>
but we got 175 tons to Miami.<br/>
<br/>
Gacha's Mexican routes<br/>
are opening up Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
But do you know what matters most<br/>
for our business, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
That the situation at home stays calm.<br/>
Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
You should have<br/>
consulted with me about Galán.<br/>
<br/>
You would have tried to talk me out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I would have tried.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of money we are losing<br/>
is because of that bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Are you listening?<br/>
<br/>
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
I'll die...<br/>
before I ever leave Colombia again.<br/>
<br/>
What's happening, Carrillo?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for coming.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the narcos<br/>
are back from Panama.<br/>
<br/>
So you practice your English with me?<br/>
<br/>
Because these men<br/>
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,<br/>
<br/>
it could get back to Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
So I started this to monitor<br/>
Pablo's sicarios' communications.<br/>
<br/>
SAT phones, landlines, you name it.<br/>
<br/>
I've got dozens of wiretaps,<br/>
<br/>
but I've only managed to seize<br/>
about ten kilos in the last month.<br/>
<br/>
Probably because I've listened<br/>
to my own men tipping the narcos off.<br/>
<br/>
So I've had to start surveilling them.<br/>
<br/>
I listen to them<br/>
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...<br/>
<br/>
cry to their mothers<br/>
when one of our men gets sh*t down.<br/>
<br/>
But every once in a while...<br/>
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Do your bosses know you're doing this?<br/>
<br/>
I trust them even less.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my men are from here,<br/>
<br/>
where they can get to your mother,<br/>
your aunt, your cousin.<br/>
<br/>
How do I fight... when my soldiers<br/>
are already working for Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Well, do they have to be from Medellín?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely like the red one best.<br/>
<br/>
- Really?<br/>
- Mm.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer the gray.<br/>
<br/>
Red is the color of the party,<br/>
<br/>
and it makes you more...<br/>
sociable and close to the people.<br/>
<br/>
- That's important.<br/>
- Mm.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what Luis Carlos<br/>
would have chosen?<br/>
<br/>
You know, we should<br/>
also hire an image consultant.<br/>
<br/>
We have to make you more appealing<br/>
to the youth, give you a more modern look.<br/>
<br/>
Now you are going to give me image advice?<br/>
<br/>
I'm just thinking about the polls.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Galán had professionals at his side,<br/>
but which could he trust?<br/>
<br/>
Hm?<br/>
<br/>
And you know perfectly well<br/>
that you can trust me, right?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what are you going to choose,<br/>
red or gray?<br/>
<br/>
Luis Carlos said something to me<br/>
before he died.<br/>
<br/>
""There will be a future.""<br/>
<br/>
Now let's see what kind of future it is.<br/>
<br/>
We worked together in the ministry.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that<br/>
he's a presidential candidate<br/>
<br/>
shows you our sad state of affairs.<br/>
<br/>
I need to know which side he is on.<br/>
<br/>
He speaks with<br/>
the Foreign Press next week.<br/>
<br/>
They'll certainly ask his position.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, Pablo.<br/>
He'll be easy to influence.<br/>
<br/>
- No, I disagree.<br/>
- Why?<br/>
<br/>
I did an interview with him once,<br/>
when he was an economic advisor.<br/>
<br/>
I found him sitting in the parking lot<br/>
in his b*at-up Renault,<br/>
<br/>
eating a bag of apples...<br/>
and reading economic reform textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
He was testifying to the cabinet<br/>
and wanted to be ready.<br/>
<br/>
He's a bookworm, not a leader.<br/>
<br/>
- No... No...<br/>
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
- He's not an oligarch.<br/>
<br/>
He's from modest circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Like you,<br/>
he's worked for everything he has.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be careful<br/>
with people like that.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to deliver a message.<br/>
<br/>
We've made a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
What we have to decide is do we stick<br/>
with Pablo... or chart our own course?<br/>
<br/>
We should talk to our friends down south.<br/>
<br/>
No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you say.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen Marina?<br/>
<br/>
She told me she was<br/>
going to buy a new brush.<br/>
<br/>
You know your sister.<br/>
<br/>
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.<br/>
<br/>
You have no idea how much<br/>
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I could tell that you really wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
- Come here, baby.<br/>
- You are very patient.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
All your people were there,<br/>
your brothers...<br/>
<br/>
My brothers are driving me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
- You know what?<br/>
- What?<br/>
<br/>
They can go f*ck themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to,<br/>
they can go live in Spain...<br/>
<br/>
...but you're staying here with me.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not hide anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Not anymore.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
What do we do about my wife?<br/>
<br/>
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Just like he took care of Galán,<br/>
he can take care of your wife.<br/>
<br/>
You...<br/>
<br/>
are very evil for such a young girl.<br/>
<br/>
You've moved up, Fernando.<br/>
<br/>
From government minister<br/>
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the pay is much better.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not doing this for the money.<br/>
<br/>
What country sends its own citizens<br/>
to an iron tomb in the United States?<br/>
<br/>
I understand your dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US<br/>
puppet and you might not win the election.<br/>
<br/>
Speak out against,<br/>
you anger the US...<br/>
<br/>
and are criticized by our media<br/>
as a shill of the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
César, I was thinking I would love<br/>
to dedicate a program for your campaign.<br/>
<br/>
It would be an honor for me,<br/>
and would benefit us both.<br/>
<br/>
What a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
You guys are really shameless,<br/>
aren't you?<br/>
<br/>
- How do you sleep at night?<br/>
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.<br/>
<br/>
If Luis had been as smart as you,<br/>
<br/>
perhaps we could have avoided<br/>
this horrible tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
We could have had peace.<br/>
<br/>
Easy.<br/>
<br/>
Get out.<br/>
<br/>
Read Pablo's letter.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you will have a future.<br/>
<br/>
They just picked up<br/>
that commie priest, Father Sobrino.<br/>
<br/>
He's gonna talk. And when he does,<br/>
I hope you DEA boys understand<br/>
<br/>
what's important in this hemisphere.<br/>
<br/>
Well, how about you, uh...<br/>
clue us in?<br/>
<br/>
Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,<br/>
they want your money.<br/>
<br/>
Communists want everything.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about you, Peña, but I...<br/>
I like to own shit.<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
Good talk, Lou.<br/>
<br/>
- Very, uh... enlightening.<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...<br/>
<br/>
This... priest?<br/>
<br/>
If it comes out that he was your informant<br/>
and you protected him...<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna make sure<br/>
you're tried for treason.<br/>
<br/>
Peña had to figure out<br/>
how to get fake papers for Elisa.<br/>
<br/>
So he did what he does best.<br/>
<br/>
Let me guess: it's a very<br/>
sad and complicated situation<br/>
<br/>
involving you and a beautiful local.<br/>
<br/>
You got your nails done.<br/>
It's... It's your color, Colleen.<br/>
<br/>
- What do you want, Javier?<br/>
- It's simple.<br/>
<br/>
I just need your signature...<br/>
right there.<br/>
<br/>
You want me to create an embassy ID?<br/>
<br/>
- Who is this woman?<br/>
- What I want you to do<br/>
<br/>
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy<br/>
and help someone stay alive.<br/>
<br/>
You really think I'd be asking you<br/>
if it wasn't important?<br/>
<br/>
She's my informant.<br/>
<br/>
And she could be the key to bringing down<br/>
the whole Medellín cartel,<br/>
<br/>
so come on, Colleen,<br/>
whose side are you on?<br/>
<br/>
Cousin, what happened?<br/>
<br/>
Where were you?<br/>
<br/>
- In the office.<br/>
- In the office?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Is that where you were?<br/>
<br/>
That's weird...<br/>
<br/>
because I called<br/>
and they said you hadn't been in all day.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know which office you called,<br/>
but I was there.<br/>
<br/>
They're seizing everything, Pablo.<br/>
All the accounts...<br/>
<br/>
We knew there would<br/>
be a reaction with Galán, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, because everything<br/>
will calm down later.<br/>
<br/>
What are you gonna do?<br/>
Are you gonna k*ll us both?<br/>
<br/>
- You afraid to die?<br/>
- No. Are you?<br/>
<br/>
- Put it out.<br/>
- Where were you?<br/>
<br/>
Put it out, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Put it out, Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Are you with me or what?<br/>
<br/>
And when have I not been with you?<br/>
<br/>
From the beginning,<br/>
it has been you and me.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot do this without you.<br/>
<br/>
Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm having serious doubts<br/>
about the Ochoas.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria read Pablo's letter.<br/>
<br/>
The terms were simple.<br/>
<br/>
He promised peace<br/>
if the narcos were left alone...<br/>
<br/>
and if not...<br/>
he promised all-out w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo with his wiretaps<br/>
knew a storm was on the horizon.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo became his duty<br/>
and his obsession.<br/>
<br/>
He came to recognize Pablo's voice,<br/>
<br/>
his sleep patterns,<br/>
what he liked to eat,<br/>
<br/>
his tastes in art,<br/>
his love of silk sheets,<br/>
<br/>
and his favorite music.<br/>
<br/>
He would die<br/>
for the love of his wife<br/>
<br/>
when you'd hear him over the airwaves.<br/>
<br/>
But did she know<br/>
how easily he ordered his men to k*ll?<br/>
<br/>
He came to understand<br/>
that Pablo spoke in code.<br/>
<br/>
Time to thin the herd.<br/>
<br/>
""Cattle"" were judges<br/>
or politicians who supported extradition.<br/>
<br/>
But did we score a goal?<br/>
<br/>
The reporter, right.<br/>
<br/>
Let's make sure<br/>
we score a goal on him as well.<br/>
<br/>
A ""goal"" was a targeted assassination.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on.<br/>
<br/>
If you spoke out against him,<br/>
you were d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
- The list grew by the week.<br/>
- Ooh!<br/>
<br/>
Guillermo Cano, editor of El Espectador,<br/>
<br/>
and his reporter, Luis Camacho.<br/>
<br/>
Jaime Rodríguez, the former head<br/>
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
The drumbeat went on and on.<br/>
<br/>
For Carrillo,<br/>
the w*r had already started.<br/>
<br/>
But he just couldn't trust his army.<br/>
<br/>
You are aware<br/>
that I can end your military career?<br/>
<br/>
- I don't give a f*ck.<br/>
- Excuse me?<br/>
<br/>
Horacio... don't give up.<br/>
<br/>
You've always been the leader<br/>
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Is this how you show your appreciation<br/>
for all we've done?<br/>
<br/>
This operation<br/>
could be a failure before it starts.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not here for fun.<br/>
<br/>
What's gonna happen<br/>
is the defense minister<br/>
<br/>
will give you credit for the evidence<br/>
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.<br/>
<br/>
So... then if you resign,<br/>
I will look really bad.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you're doing?<br/>
Is that what you want?<br/>
<br/>
Horacio...<br/>
you remember when were cadets,<br/>
<br/>
we never thought they would call us<br/>
to lead the country's most important unit.<br/>
<br/>
Horacio, as your friend...<br/>
I'm asking you to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.<br/>
<br/>
It could be any of us three.<br/>
<br/>
- Horacio, please.<br/>
- I've put my family at risk.<br/>
<br/>
If there is going to be a w*r,<br/>
I need the right tools.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Then tell me what you need.<br/>
Hm?<br/>
<br/>
Incorruptible men.<br/>
<br/>
And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.<br/>
<br/>
But Carrillo<br/>
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, punk.<br/>
Are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
- Sure.<br/>
- Come here.<br/>
<br/>
La Quica and Poison<br/>
had kids deliver packages.<br/>
<br/>
And if they didn't look inside,<br/>
<br/>
it meant they could be trusted<br/>
to deliver anything from cocaine to...<br/>
<br/>
well, anything else.<br/>
<br/>
How are you, son?<br/>
<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
- Good.<br/>
<br/>
I have to k*ll that son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo's a cop.<br/>
You can always buy a cop with money.<br/>
<br/>
- I've tried, believe me.<br/>
- Then offer more.<br/>
<br/>
Or I can loan you Navegante.<br/>
He will do whatever I ask.<br/>
<br/>
That's true.<br/>
<br/>
It's silver or lead.<br/>
That's the choice for that bastard.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of lead,<br/>
I'm getting a shipment of w*apon in.<br/>
<br/>
Uzis, grenades...<br/>
<br/>
If I could find a nuclear w*apon...<br/>
But now I'm negotiating a f*cking m*ssile.<br/>
<br/>
- A m*ssile? No f*cking way.<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
- Boss.<br/>
- Eh?<br/>
<br/>
This is crack cocaine,<br/>
seized a few days ago<br/>
<br/>
by drug enforcement agents,<br/>
<br/>
in a park just across the street<br/>
from the White House.<br/>
<br/>
And our message<br/>
to the drug cartels is this:<br/>
<br/>
the rules have changed.<br/>
<br/>
He's bullshitting, right?<br/>
<br/>
He's smoking that shit.<br/>
I guarantee it.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Mm...<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Quiroga told me<br/>
the neighbors on the block took a vote.<br/>
<br/>
They want us to move.<br/>
<br/>
But we have guards stationed<br/>
outside the house 24 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
That's what scares them.<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
It won't always be like this,<br/>
my love.<br/>
<br/>
- Rodrigo.<br/>
- Hello, Horacio.<br/>
<br/>
- Everything OK?<br/>
- May I speak with you?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sure. Come in, come in.<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk about the incorruptibles.<br/>
<br/>
I'm listening.<br/>
<br/>
I've been instructed to tell you that<br/>
if you cease and desist your operations,<br/>
<br/>
you will receive<br/>
a one-time payment of six million.<br/>
<br/>
Horacio... that's US dollars,<br/>
not pesos.<br/>
<br/>
Instructed by whom?<br/>
<br/>
I think you can guess.<br/>
<br/>
Say the name.<br/>
<br/>
You know who.<br/>
<br/>
Say the name, Rodrigo.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.<br/>
I've always cared for you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm making this suggestion to save<br/>
you and your family from terrible grief.<br/>
<br/>
This man has tentacles.<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised<br/>
he hasn't k*ll you already.<br/>
<br/>
Get out.<br/>
<br/>
Horacio, please...<br/>
<br/>
Horacio...<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
<br/>
I was driving to the church.<br/>
<br/>
Was with my buddy, John.<br/>
He was my best man.<br/>
<br/>
We were late.<br/>
<br/>
It was f*cking blazing outside,<br/>
110 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Whole bridal party was there<br/>
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.<br/>
<br/>
And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't tell me<br/>
you left her at the altar.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if she actually<br/>
made it to the altar.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you saved her<br/>
a lifetime of hell.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.<br/>
<br/>
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.<br/>
- Hm.<br/>
<br/>
Randy... I think.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, she's better off.<br/>
<br/>
What if Father Sobrino talks?<br/>
<br/>
He's gonna talk.<br/>
<br/>
It's about time, Navegante.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.<br/>
<br/>
What do you got?<br/>
<br/>
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.<br/>
<br/>
I can help you get him.<br/>
<br/>
You said you had information.<br/>
You didn't say Gacha.<br/>
<br/>
I guess is your lucky day.<br/>
<br/>
- What's the informant's motivation?<br/>
- Could be money.<br/>
<br/>
The reward for Gacha is one million US.<br/>
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.<br/>
<br/>
He spends his life on the run<br/>
if we don't catch him.<br/>
<br/>
- Something else going on with this guy.<br/>
- It's worth taking a risk.<br/>
<br/>
Peña, you go to Cartagena.<br/>
Solely in an observational capacity.<br/>
<br/>
We want this man captured alive,<br/>
if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Gaviria's press conference is tonight,<br/>
<br/>
and I wanna be sure whatever<br/>
he plans to say, he gets to say it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
That's a beautiful dress,<br/>
Ambassador Noonan.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
More? You want more?<br/>
<br/>
No! No more, please! No more!<br/>
<br/>
No more!<br/>
<br/>
Ah, he's all yours.<br/>
He's ready to talk.<br/>
<br/>
Father...<br/>
<br/>
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?<br/>
<br/>
She left with the American woman.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy's wife.<br/>
<br/>
I just don't understand.<br/>
How'd you get involved with communists?<br/>
<br/>
Have you actually met a communist?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I have, actually...<br/>
and she lied to me.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.<br/>
<br/>
I'm fighting against poverty,<br/>
corruption, injustice and greed.<br/>
<br/>
But I guess Americans<br/>
don't have the same problem.<br/>
<br/>
Don't we?<br/>
<br/>
It's not the same.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I just wish<br/>
you'd been straight with me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should go.<br/>
<br/>
You can't just go.<br/>
Look, if they find you, they'll k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
I fell in love with a man...<br/>
with a good man.<br/>
<br/>
And I was hoping<br/>
to do something good.<br/>
<br/>
But instead, I fell into something...<br/>
else, something more violent.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that makes two of us.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you when I get home.<br/>
<br/>
Here, Elisa's ID.<br/>
<br/>
- What am I supposed to do with that?<br/>
- Take her to Cumaral.<br/>
<br/>
My contact there agreed to hide her.<br/>
<br/>
While you go to Cartagena?<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe this shit.<br/>
<br/>
- Who made this?<br/>
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?<br/>
<br/>
Jump out of a window?<br/>
<br/>
Look, she's...<br/>
<br/>
- She's important.<br/>
- To who?<br/>
<br/>
To us.<br/>
<br/>
I take care of Elisa...<br/>
you better f*cking get Gacha.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a romantic date.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long time<br/>
since we've been alone.<br/>
<br/>
Mm. Just you, me...<br/>
and our bodyguard.<br/>
<br/>
Like the old days when we were young<br/>
and your father watched us.<br/>
<br/>
- Mm. My father adored you.<br/>
- Yeah, right.<br/>
<br/>
Garcia...<br/>
<br/>
Hello? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
But he's all right?<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Ana?<br/>
<br/>
Ana?<br/>
<br/>
Ana?<br/>
<br/>
Ana!<br/>
<br/>
A little bird... came into the house.<br/>
<br/>
I'm helping it out.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
There was an assassination attempt...<br/>
<br/>
on Colonel Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
Did someone die?<br/>
<br/>
One of his men.<br/>
<br/>
It must be terrible,<br/>
<br/>
the position you're in.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to know<br/>
I think you are very brave.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.<br/>
<br/>
That fear keeps you alive.<br/>
<br/>
That's what none of them understand.<br/>
<br/>
I will support any decision you make.<br/>
<br/>
It's been said that<br/>
nothing gives the fearful more courage...<br/>
<br/>
than another's fear.<br/>
<br/>
Luis Carlos Galán<br/>
had made a decision that cost his life.<br/>
<br/>
And now, it was Gaviria's turn.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, American press.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, I have the great pleasure<br/>
<br/>
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
It has long been<br/>
our government's policy...<br/>
<br/>
to deal with every man equally...<br/>
in the eyes of the law.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
Colombians say...<br/>
<br/>
God made our land so beautiful...<br/>
<br/>
it was unfair to the rest of the world.<br/>
<br/>
So to even the score...<br/>
<br/>
God populated the land...<br/>
with a race of evil men.<br/>
<br/>
The primary impediment<br/>
to a free and uninhibited future<br/>
<br/>
is the v*olence and terror<br/>
that currently grips our beloved country.<br/>
<br/>
A v*olence initiated by these evil men...<br/>
<br/>
will be brought to justice...<br/>
<br/>
in the name of decency...<br/>
<br/>
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.<br/>
<br/>
We will extradite.<br/>
<br/>
This decision...<br/>
will not come from fear.<br/>
<br/>
It has come from a clarity of judgment...<br/>
<br/>
free from the cloud of terror<br/>
that surrounds us<br/>
<br/>
and obscures our view.<br/>
<br/>
I can say only one thing to Colombians<br/>
in these times of peril:<br/>
<br/>
There will be a future.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
You think you're hot shit?<br/>
<br/>
You should change your satellite phone.<br/>
<br/>
Who is this?<br/>
<br/>
Your mother's in Rionegro<br/>
with that tub of lard you call your son.<br/>
<br/>
And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,<br/>
shopping for clothes.<br/>
<br/>
You bastard son of a bitch,<br/>
you think that...<br/>
<br/>
What, you think because you're a cop<br/>
I'm afraid of you or something?<br/>
<br/>
You know where my family is, f*g,<br/>
well, I know where yours is, too.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't forget that.<br/>
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you take money<br/>
like everyone else?<br/>
<br/>
I could have had you living like a king.<br/>
But now, guess what?<br/>
<br/>
Time to k*ll your dad, your mom,<br/>
your kids, your entire family,<br/>
<br/>
and you should be smart enough to realize<br/>
<br/>
I have each and every one of them<br/>
under watch, you f*cking bastard.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You just keep hiding,<br/>
and I will find you.<br/>
<br/>
Don't know when...<br/>
<br/>
but I will find you.<br/>
<br/>
And when I find you...<br/>
<br/>
- I'm going to k*ll you.<br/>
- I'm going to k*ll you<br/>
<br/>
and your entire family,<br/>
you son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
It's w*r, then.</div>]","Beloved countrymen,

the New Liberalism party
is the only force in Colombia

that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

""There are
three ways the narcotraffickers...

- try to weaken extradition.""
- ...try to weaken extradition.

- ""Bribery...""
- Bribery...

""...intimidation through v*olence...""

...intimidation through v*olence...

- ""...and extortion.""
- ...and extortion!

- ""A dark and terrible scourge.""
- A dark and terrible scourge.

What are you doing?

Just making sure he gets it right.

You wrote it, you should know.

- Mm.
- Look, I brought you this.

What's this?

Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

How's Galán doing?

All right.

I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

There are other things to mention.

Galán's got some balls.

Brave men have a way of dying quickly.

Well, then, you don't have to worry...
do you?

Aah...

Pass me the socks.

First thing
is that we get you out of Bogotá.

- OK.
- There's an orphanage in Cumaral.

It's out of the guerrilla zone
and away from the narcos.

And then what?

We get you a passport.

From another country, we can depose you
about Escobar and the siege.

You may have run away from your country,
but I'm not running away from mine.

This is about keeping you alive.

Do you sleep with all your informants?

I'm not your responsibility.

If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll k*ll you in a heartbeat.

Not if I k*ll him first.

Yeah, she's a live hand grenade.

She's the only witness we got that
can tie Escobar to the palace m*ssacre.

Hard to bring her in when
she gets turned over to the Colombians

and she gets disappeared.
Are you ready for that?

No.

So what's our options,
since we have none?

Well, we keep her in hiding
until things cool down,

and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

Are you gonna get us immunity?

We are going to jail
if we get caught with this woman.

Well, the next time your wife decides
to bring home a human hand grenade,

how about she hands it to you?

Are you f*cking her?

Sleep with a communist?

That would be downright un-American.

Any intel to support the DEA theory

that Escobar is behind
the Palace of Justice siege?

No, ma'am.

Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect,

but he hasn't brought him forward.

In my book,
there's only two of them that know that.

And one of them is Elisa Alvaro,
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.

The other one is Ernesto Sobrino,

a radical priest who gave shelter
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos comuna.

Is one of these people your informant?

Ambassador, this is...
unofficial wiretap information.

We, uh, intercepted
a discussion between narcos.

What? Which narcos?

- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- We're almost certain.

It was, uh...
It was hard to tell.

The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

and they know
that he'll support extradition,

and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,

and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

That's horseshit, Peña.
Excuse me, Ambassador.

On one hand, you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

You can't have it both ways, son.

Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us
fight communism all over Latin America

for the last two decades.

I take great offense at any attempt
by the DEA to smear his good name.

I couldn't help but laugh.

Right wing, left wing...

For Manuel Noriega,
it was all about the money.

When Bush was head of the CIA,
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater

so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug tr*ffick.

When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs

by siding with communists,
he switched teams.

So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested ""Old Pineapple Face.""

But, that was later.

For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset

who was taking money from Bush...
and right from the narcos.

Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian
Supreme Court to fight extradition.

And now, he was offering
to pay off Colombia's national debt

in exchange for a truce.

Guess he missed home.

Look at this
shit. We are spending millions of dollars,

and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

Listen, the problem isn't the food,
the problem is Noriega.

First chance he gets,
he'll sell us to the Americans.

You guys stay calm.

Once we reach an agreement with the
government, we'll be back in our homeland.

Pay the Colombian
national debt for amnesty?

I'd rather go live in Spain.

I say we go back and fight.

No, sir, none of that.
w*r is bad for business.

We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

Look, Gustavo,
none of this would've happened

if he hadn't started
k*ll politicians and judges.

Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

You know something, Pablo?

Sometimes, I think you k*ll these men
because they won't let you in their club.

You better watch your mouth, assh*le.

The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

Get used to the food, gentlemen.

It's not safe to go back home.

They've rejected our amnesty deal.

We may have to stay.

I hate this place.

We can go someplace else.

I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

In Switzerland,
we are nobody, Pablo.

What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

Do whatever is necessary,
my love.

So, there it was.

The decision that would
change Colombia forever.

You're way ahead in the polls.

In my opinion,
the outcome is decided.

My question is... why do you
keep getting involved with the narcos?

I want a country at peace.

And if I don't do it, who will?

You're backing them into a corner.

I'm wearing a vest.

I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

Don't worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

Luis Carlos Galán
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th,

against the advice
of his campaign manager, César Gaviria.

The b*ll*ts entered just below
his vest and he was d*ad within minutes.

For a brief shining moment,
there was hope...

extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.

To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...

and in the cities, thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent,

a mute protest
against the v*olence of the narcos.

With Galán's m*rder... came the end
of hope for a peaceful future.

Let's speak clearly, brother.

Galán's d*ad.

You had him k*ll,
didn't you?

You didn't tell us shit,
and you k*ll him, you son of a bitch.

- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

All this shit you talk about partnership,
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

Galán was the only thr*at.

There is no one left to challenge us.

And you know why, Fabio.

Because no one
has the balls that we have.

Going home.

Pablo was right.

Who would have the balls
to fill Galán's shoes?

...that unique honesty.

As the people now rise
and call for justice,

I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

as motivation for society
to react and bond...

to support the government...
and institutions...

while also demanding
a more effective leadership,

one undeterred by the hitmen,
the hijackings,

or any other manifestations of v*olence.

My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

to the danger of the narcos.

The assassin's b*ll*ts...
will not stop what my father began.

As he fell,
another rises in his place.

I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

in the name of the people of Colombia,
and my family...

that we entrust my father's ideals to him,
and that he can count on our support...

to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!

Dr. César Gaviria...
the new hope of Colombia.

If he took Galán's position on
extradition, the narcos would declare w*r.

If he didn't,
the country would become a narco state.

Phone!

Let it go to the answering machine.

The machine's full.

I wish it would stop ringing.

It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

Or opinions about what I should do.

Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

but do you even believe in them?

I don't know what I believe.

I don't want the narcos having free reign.

But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

So say nothing.

That's the best way to stay alive.

Gentlemen.

Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

We're going home!

- How are you? Hm?
- Fine, my love.

What about you?

Give me one.

Margarita, right?

Let's see.

- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right?

Thank you.
Listen, I've got a question for you.

Why are we going back?

We're walking into a world of shit.

Relax, brother.

Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

We need to be close by.
Relax.

Don't you get it?

He's only comfortable at w*r.

He's taking us to the slaughter.

How's business?

f*cking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

Sure.

You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

You would have tried to talk me out of it.

Yes.

I would have tried.

The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

Are you listening?

Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

What's happening, Carrillo?

Thank you for coming.

I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

So you practice your English with me?

Because these men
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,

it could get back to Pablo.

So I started this to monitor
Pablo's sicarios' communications.

SAT phones, landlines, you name it.

I've got dozens of wiretaps,

but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

So I've had to start surveilling them.

I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets sh*t down.

But every once in a while...
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

Do your bosses know you're doing this?

I trust them even less.

Most of my men are from here,

where they can get to your mother,
your aunt, your cousin.

How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

Well, do they have to be from Medellín?

Yes.

I definitely like the red one best.

- Really?
- Mm.

I prefer the gray.

Red is the color of the party,

and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

- That's important.
- Mm.

I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

We have to make you more appealing
to the youth, give you a more modern look.

Now you are going to give me image advice?

I'm just thinking about the polls.

Anyway...

Galán had professionals at his side,
but which could he trust?

Hm?

And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me, right?

Mm-hm.

Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

""There will be a future.""

Now let's see what kind of future it is.

We worked together in the ministry.

The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

shows you our sad state of affairs.

I need to know which side he is on.

He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

They'll certainly ask his position.

Don't worry, Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

- No, I disagree.
- Why?

I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his b*at-up Renault,

eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

He's a bookworm, not a leader.

- No... No...
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.

- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

He's from modest circumstances.

Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

You have to be careful
with people like that.

I want you to deliver a message.

We've made a lot of money.

What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

We should talk to our friends down south.

No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?

Whatever you say.

Have you seen Marina?

She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

You know your sister.

Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

I could tell that you really wanted to.

- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

Yes, of course.

All your people were there,
your brothers...

My brothers are driving me crazy.

- You know what?
- What?

They can go f*ck themselves.

If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

...but you're staying here with me.

Let's not hide anymore.

Not anymore.

All right.

What do we do about my wife?

Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

You...

are very evil for such a young girl.

You've moved up, Fernando.

From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

I guess the pay is much better.

I'm not doing this for the money.

What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

I understand your dilemma.

Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

Speak out against,
you anger the US...

and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

What a great idea.

You guys are really shameless,
aren't you?

- How do you sleep at night?
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.

If Luis had been as smart as you,

perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

We could have had peace.

Easy.

Get out.

Read Pablo's letter.

Maybe you will have a future.

They just picked up
that commie priest, Father Sobrino.

He's gonna talk. And when he does,
I hope you DEA boys understand

what's important in this hemisphere.

Well, how about you, uh...
clue us in?

Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,
they want your money.

Communists want everything.

I don't know about you, Peña, but I...
I like to own shit.

Right.

Good talk, Lou.

- Very, uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

Oh...

This... priest?

If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

Peña had to figure out
how to get fake papers for Elisa.

So he did what he does best.

Let me guess: it's a very
sad and complicated situation

involving you and a beautiful local.

You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color, Colleen.

- What do you want, Javier?
- It's simple.

I just need your signature...
right there.

You want me to create an embassy ID?

- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

She's my informant.

And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel,

so come on, Colleen,
whose side are you on?

Cousin, what happened?

Where were you?

- In the office.
- In the office?

Yes.

Is that where you were?

That's weird...

because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts...

We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

Yeah.

Relax, Gustavo.

Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna k*ll us both?

- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

- Put it out.
- Where were you?

Put it out, Pablo.

Put it out, Pablo!

Are you with me or what?

And when have I not been with you?

From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

I cannot do this without you.

Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

No.

But I'm having serious doubts
about the Ochoas.

Gaviria read Pablo's letter.

The terms were simple.

He promised peace
if the narcos were left alone...

and if not...
he promised all-out w*r.

Carrillo with his wiretaps
knew a storm was on the horizon.

Pablo became his duty
and his obsession.

He came to recognize Pablo's voice,

his sleep patterns,
what he liked to eat,

his tastes in art,
his love of silk sheets,

and his favorite music.

He would die
for the love of his wife

when you'd hear him over the airwaves.

But did she know
how easily he ordered his men to k*ll?

He came to understand
that Pablo spoke in code.

Time to thin the herd.

""Cattle"" were judges
or politicians who supported extradition.

But did we score a goal?

The reporter, right.

Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

A ""goal"" was a targeted assassination.

Come on, come on.

If you spoke out against him,
you were d*ad.

- The list grew by the week.
- Ooh!

Guillermo Cano, editor of El Espectador,

and his reporter, Luis Camacho.

Jaime Rodríguez, the former head
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.

The drumbeat went on and on.

For Carrillo,
the w*r had already started.

But he just couldn't trust his army.

You are aware
that I can end your military career?

- I don't give a f*ck.
- Excuse me?

Horacio... don't give up.

You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

I'm not here for fun.

What's gonna happen
is the defense minister

will give you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

Is that what you're doing?
Is that what you want?

Horacio...
you remember when were cadets,

we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

Horacio, as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.

It could be any of us three.

- Horacio, please.
- I've put my family at risk.

If there is going to be a w*r,
I need the right tools.

All right.

Perfect.

Then tell me what you need.
Hm?

Incorruptible men.

And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.

But Carrillo
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.

Hey, punk.
Are you all right?

- Sure.
- Come here.

La Quica and Poison
had kids deliver packages.

And if they didn't look inside,

it meant they could be trusted
to deliver anything from cocaine to...

well, anything else.

How are you, son?

- How are you?
- Good.

I have to k*ll that son of a bitch.

Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

- I've tried, believe me.
- Then offer more.

Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

That's true.

It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of w*apon in.

Uzis, grenades...

If I could find a nuclear w*apon...
But now I'm negotiating a f*cking m*ssile.

- A m*ssile? No f*cking way.
- Yes.

- Boss.
- Eh?

This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago

by drug enforcement agents,

in a park just across the street
from the White House.

And our message
to the drug cartels is this:

the rules have changed.

He's bullshitting, right?

He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

f*ck.

Mm...

Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

They want us to move.

But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

That's what scares them.

Come here.

It won't always be like this,
my love.

- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

Yes, sure. Come in, come in.

Let's talk about the incorruptibles.

I'm listening.

I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

Horacio... that's US dollars,
not pesos.

Instructed by whom?

I think you can guess.

Say the name.

You know who.

Say the name, Rodrigo.

Escobar.

Don't look at me like that, Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

This man has tentacles.

I'm surprised
he hasn't k*ll you already.

Get out.

Horacio, please...

Horacio...

Take care.

I was driving to the church.

Was with my buddy, John.
He was my best man.

We were late.

It was f*cking blazing outside,
110 degrees.

Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.

And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.

Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

Well, you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.

- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

Randy... I think.

Trust me, she's better off.

What if Father Sobrino talks?

He's gonna talk.

It's about time, Navegante.

Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

What do you got?

Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

I can help you get him.

You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

I guess is your lucky day.

- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

Peña, you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

We want this man captured alive,
if possible.

Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

Gaviria's press conference is tonight,

and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say, he gets to say it.

Yes, ma'am.

That's a beautiful dress,
Ambassador Noonan.

Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!

Huh?

Huh?

More? You want more?

No! No more, please! No more!

No more!

Ah, he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

Father...

how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

She left with the American woman.

Murphy's wife.

I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

Have you actually met a communist?

Yeah, I have, actually...
and she lied to me.

Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.

I'm fighting against poverty,
corruption, injustice and greed.

But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

Don't we?

It's not the same.

Look, I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

I'm sorry.

Perhaps I should go.

You can't just go.
Look, if they find you, they'll k*ll you.

I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

And I was hoping
to do something good.

But instead, I fell into something...
else, something more violent.

Yeah, that makes two of us.

I'll see you when I get home.

Here, Elisa's ID.

- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

My contact there agreed to hide her.

While you go to Cartagena?

I can't believe this shit.

- Who made this?
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?

Jump out of a window?

Look, she's...

- She's important.
- To who?

To us.

I take care of Elisa...
you better f*cking get Gacha.

Finally, a romantic date.

It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

Mm. Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

- Mm. My father adored you.
- Yeah, right.

Garcia...

Hello? Yes.

Yes.

But he's all right?

All right.

Ana?

Ana?

Ana?

Ana!

A little bird... came into the house.

I'm helping it out.

What?

There was an assassination attempt...

on Colonel Carrillo.

Did someone die?

One of his men.

It must be terrible,

the position you're in.

I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

That fear keeps you alive.

That's what none of them understand.

I will support any decision you make.

It's been said that
nothing gives the fearful more courage...

than another's fear.

Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.

And now, it was Gaviria's turn.

Welcome, American press.

Tonight, I have the great pleasure

of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

It has long been
our government's policy...

to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

So...

Colombians say...

God made our land so beautiful...

it was unfair to the rest of the world.

So to even the score...

God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

The primary impediment
to a free and uninhibited future

is the v*olence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.

A v*olence initiated by these evil men...

will be brought to justice...

in the name of decency...

and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

We will extradite.

This decision...
will not come from fear.

It has come from a clarity of judgment...

free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

and obscures our view.

I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

There will be a future.

Thank you.

Hello?

You think you're hot shit?

You should change your satellite phone.

Who is this?

Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.

And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.

You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that...

What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

You know where my family is, f*g,
well, I know where yours is, too.

- Don't forget that.
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

Time to k*ll your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

and you should be smart enough to realize

I have each and every one of them
under watch, you f*cking bastard.

Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.

You just keep hiding,
and I will find you.

Don't know when...

but I will find you.

And when I find you...

- I'm going to k*ll you.
- I'm going to k*ll you

and your entire family,
you son of a bitch!

It's w*r, then."

<br/>
Murphy, join the party, huh?<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
All you guys having a good time?<br/>
<br/>
You gotta let it go, man. There's good that came out of this.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we used him, then we got him k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
No, we didn't k*ll him... Escobar did.<br/>
<br/>
And now we get to go after that f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Look on the bright side, huh? - [Slaps Steve's back]<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Pena was right. There was a sllverlinlng.<br/>
<br/>
One of the sicarios caught after Lara Bonilla's assasslnatlon<br/>
<br/>
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.<br/>
<br/>
An important politician had been m*rder and everyone knew who dld lt.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the Colombian government had to react.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobarwas indicted forthe m*rder Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,<br/>
<br/>
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA $100,000 REWARD<br/>
<br/>
Colombia agreed to the one thlng narcos feared most. Extradition.<br/>
<br/>
Now any Colombian who smuggled drugs to America<br/>
<br/>
could be prosecuted and jalled in the US,<br/>
<br/>
even if they never stepped foot on our soil.<br/>
<br/>
This made all the dlfference in the world.<br/>
<br/>
- [Latin music plays nearby] - If you were a narco In Colombla,<br/>
<br/>
jall time meant banging girls, watching movies,<br/>
<br/>
hanging with the fellas...<br/>
<br/>
Grease the right hands and you'd get a reduced sentence for good behavlor.<br/>
<br/>
It was a f*cking joke,<br/>
<br/>
Back home, it was a whole dlfferent deal.<br/>
<br/>
The seventh richest man in the world? No one glves a shit.<br/>
<br/>
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day, just like every other loser,<br/>
<br/>
a f*cking nightmare,<br/>
<br/>
Now Pablo had someone to fear: Us.<br/>
<br/>
[Latin guitartheme music plays]<br/>
<br/>
Extradition doesn't mean anything unless you can catch him.<br/>
<br/>
- With our help, you will. - Oh, that's right.<br/>
<br/>
Gringos to the rescue.<br/>
<br/>
[Dry chuckle] It's one f*cking man against the United States of America.<br/>
<br/>
One man with helicopters, airplanes, vehicles, planned escape routes,<br/>
<br/>
- and a network of informants. - Our government will provide money,<br/>
<br/>
- men, w*apon... - You make it sound so easy.<br/>
<br/>
But Escobar has always managed to stay one step ahead of us.<br/>
<br/>
Help us catch him.<br/>
<br/>
I'll never be assigned to this. Jaramillo hates my guts.<br/>
<br/>
Let me take care of that.<br/>
<br/>
- You think extradition's a victory. - It is.<br/>
<br/>
Escobarwill not go lightly.<br/>
<br/>
He will make Colombia bleed.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Now more than ever is the time for solidarity.<br/>
<br/>
You make the mistakes, and then you preach solidarity?<br/>
<br/>
- Shut up, f*g. - What the f*ck, Carlos?<br/>
<br/>
Why are you always defending him?<br/>
<br/>
Did he get your sister back for you or not?<br/>
<br/>
We rescued her because we did it together. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen...<br/>
<br/>
I suggest we form anotherorganization<br/>
<br/>
to fight against the injustice of extradition.<br/>
<br/>
Like John Lennon said,<br/>
<br/>
- ""Come together, brothers and sisters...'' - Stop that f*g shit right now.<br/>
<br/>
So Jorge...<br/>
<br/>
what will we call it?<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] First, ''Death to Kidnappers,'' then ""the Extradltables.''<br/>
<br/>
Once again, the narcos were united agalnst a common enemy. Jail In America.<br/>
<br/>
But it was not quite like ""one forall, and all forone.""<br/>
<br/>
It was more like each man for himself.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Next!<br/>
<br/>
Gacha, being Gacha, declded that all he had to do to defeat extradltlon<br/>
<br/>
- was k*ll anyone who tried to arrest him. - [Man] f*re!<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] So he hired a bunch of Israelimercenaries and prepared for w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Next!<br/>
<br/>
Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite and took to the alrwaves.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] The gringos are the ones who use the drugs.<br/>
<br/>
So why are we the ones who need to be extradited?<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] I'm not sure how helpful that was.<br/>
<br/>
[Carlos] I mean, all of our problems...<br/>
<br/>
are because of those imperialist gringos!<br/>
<br/>
[Sniffs] No, stay there... stay there.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] As forthe Ochoa brothers, they went with a fancy PR flrm<br/>
<br/>
and got ripped off because, well... that's what PR agencies do.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] ""Better a grave in Oolombia<br/>
<br/>
than a grave in the United States.""<br/>
<br/>
No, I've got t, Fabio, I've got it. Let's see...<br/>
<br/>
""Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the United States.""<br/>
<br/>
- What do you think? - I love it.<br/>
<br/>
- [Jorge chuckling] - Very good.<br/>
<br/>
And for $50,000 more, we'll make your logo.<br/>
<br/>
Done.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] By the way, here's the logo $50,000 got you.<br/>
<br/>
In the upcoming presidential election, extradltion became the defining Issue<br/>
<br/>
amongst the candidates.<br/>
<br/>
Those the narcos could buy, they bought.<br/>
<br/>
The ones they could scare, they scared.<br/>
<br/>
But Luis Carlos Galán was nelther.<br/>
<br/>
And so, unable to buy him and unable to scare him,<br/>
<br/>
Escobar tried out that fancy new statlonery,<br/>
<br/>
and he wrote Galán a letter.<br/>
<br/>
[In English] ""And to conclude, I want to express my most energetic protest<br/>
<br/>
over the improper interference of North America<br/>
<br/>
n a way that entails the most flagrant violation<br/>
<br/>
of the sovereignty of our Motherland.""<br/>
<br/>
He's got some balls.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar is shameless.<br/>
<br/>
The United States is inclined to support your bid forthe presidency, Mr. Galán.<br/>
<br/>
But even if we indict these narcos in the United States,<br/>
<br/>
we still can't get them there without Colombian approval.<br/>
<br/>
We're curious as to your view on extradition.<br/>
<br/>
My campaign manager, Dr. Gaviria,<br/>
<br/>
doesn't want me to stick my foot in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
America wants Pablo Escobar to prove they're winning a battle,<br/>
<br/>
when clearly, they're losing a w*r.<br/>
<br/>
I'll do what's best forColombia.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] If you speak in favor of extradition, you will be their puppet,<br/>
<br/>
and that will be your death sentence.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care about the Americans, but I am still going to support extradition.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if the gringos want to take away all the g*dd*mn k*ll of this country,<br/>
<br/>
then let them take them.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Slnce he couldn't get to Galán,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo reached out to many of the country's judges.<br/>
<br/>
He figured out that a sanctioned law would do no harm<br/>
<br/>
if no judge was willing to apply it.<br/>
<br/>
""As you pass judgment on one of our sons<br/>
<br/>
and considersending him to hls fate in the Unlted States,<br/>
<br/>
know we, the Extraditables, wlll pass judgment on you<br/>
<br/>
and bring a sentence far harsher.""<br/>
<br/>
The judges were so scared and Intimidated<br/>
<br/>
that special court procedures had to be created.<br/>
<br/>
For the first time in the history of Colombia,<br/>
<br/>
it was the good guys who had to hide thelrfaces behlnd the masks.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Defendants, please rise.<br/>
<br/>
You've been tried and convicted of cocaine tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
You will immediately be turned over to the DEA for extradition to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Despite hls thr*at, many brave men defled hlm.<br/>
<br/>
And true to form, when the pen failed...<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was always ready with the sword.<br/>
<br/>
[Engine starts]<br/>
<br/>
In light of this terrorism, you'd thlnk that everyone in Colombla<br/>
<br/>
would've made catching Escobar the numberone prlorlty, rlght?<br/>
<br/>
Well, guess again,<br/>
<br/>
Communists. They're the real thr*at to the security of this country.<br/>
<br/>
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has k*ll more Americans than Soviet troops.<br/>
<br/>
We got FARC, we got M-19, we got EPL, we got ELN,<br/>
<br/>
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Agent Pena, but our resources gotta be directed at America's problems,<br/>
<br/>
and you don't get to tell us what those are.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Communlsts. Rememberthem?<br/>
<br/>
With Reagan in the White House, it was hard to forget,<br/>
<br/>
In his words.<br/>
<br/>
They are the focus of evil in the modern world.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] The Soviet evll empire was Reagan's thing, always had been.<br/>
<br/>
In Hollywood, he named some actors as communist sympathlzers.<br/>
<br/>
In Washington, he created the Reagan Doctrine,<br/>
<br/>
which opposed Soviet-backed communists all overthe world.<br/>
<br/>
Drug tr*ffick just dldn't rate.<br/>
<br/>
You want to turn on the tap of the rlchest country in the world,<br/>
<br/>
you'd better be chasing reds.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, if the CIA and the Mil Group provide assets,<br/>
<br/>
the Colombians will get Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
We're talking about a huge blow to the cocaine trade<br/>
<br/>
- and saving thousands of lives... - Ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
The CIA agrees with Mil Group. Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.<br/>
<br/>
He's just a wanted Colombian drug tr*ffick, and as such,<br/>
<br/>
he is not a direct thr*at to our country's strategic interests in South America.<br/>
<br/>
The CIA would prefer not to get involved in local police problems.<br/>
<br/>
Let the Colombians get him.<br/>
<br/>
Noonan really thinks allocating $100,000<br/>
<br/>
- will be enough to go after Escobar. - Yeah, it's a f*cking joke.<br/>
<br/>
That's about what he spends on shoes, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
The CNP has zero chance of capturing him with that bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
So what do we do now?<br/>
<br/>
Use what little we got to try to even the odds.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] It's true, the hundred grand wasn't that much.<br/>
<br/>
But delivered into the right hands, it could make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia, honorable men.<br/>
<br/>
But the head of counternarcotics, General Jaramlllo, wasn't one of'em,<br/>
<br/>
And as such, he was exactly what we needed.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Thank you for seeing me, General.<br/>
<br/>
You're welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I have General Gomez assigned to the operation against Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect, General Jaramillo... I propose Horacio Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders. He doesn't follow anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don't want him to follow.<br/>
<br/>
I want him to lead.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, General.<br/>
<br/>
As you wish.<br/>
<br/>
Understood.<br/>
<br/>
What happened, honey?<br/>
<br/>
Things with work.<br/>
<br/>
When will Horacio arrive to have dinnerwith us?<br/>
<br/>
I'm making the chicken he likes, but he's out with the girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what's wrong.<br/>
<br/>
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.<br/>
<br/>
They're saying that since you've become a wanted man,<br/>
<br/>
bribing the police has gotten very costly.<br/>
<br/>
They want to renegotiate the price of our routes.<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo] Hm.<br/>
<br/>
When it came to me k*ll to get their sister back, well, then...<br/>
<br/>
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. The problem is that it is one thing to k*ll communists<br/>
<br/>
- and anotherto k*ll politicians. - So what now?<br/>
<br/>
What I would do is increase the payments to the police, you know?<br/>
<br/>
And most of all, to the top brass.<br/>
<br/>
We're already giving too much money to those bastards.<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo] Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, shit. What's that? Is it snowing orwhat?<br/>
<br/>
- [Birds squawking] - [Pablo] Egrets from the Himalayas.<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
It took two years to train them to stay there.<br/>
<br/>
They cost me a million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Bastards.<br/>
<br/>
Stay in the f*cking tree!<br/>
<br/>
[Gustavo laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Seems like you lost that dough, eh, cousin?<br/>
<br/>
That's your problem, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You think that everything can be controlled,<br/>
<br/>
but it turns out that nature cannot be controlled.<br/>
<br/>
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK. [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Your English is really good.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. I took a course at the University of Antioquia.<br/>
<br/>
How long you been at the comuna?<br/>
<br/>
Just a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Is your husband gonna help us here, too?<br/>
<br/>
I saw him when he dropped you off. What does he do?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial services at the US Embassy.<br/>
<br/>
[Up-tempo Latin music plays]<br/>
<br/>
- I f*cked up. - How?<br/>
<br/>
Carrillo got the job just like you wanted.<br/>
<br/>
No, Jaramillo's sending a message.<br/>
<br/>
He's telling me I got his price wrong.<br/>
<br/>
He's setting Carrillo up forfailure, and when he does fail,<br/>
<br/>
he'll f*re him for incompetence,<br/>
<br/>
and me and you, we lose the only cop we can trust.<br/>
<br/>
[Women chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
- Hey! - Hey!<br/>
<br/>
- Sorry I'm late, honey. - Mm...<br/>
<br/>
Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.<br/>
<br/>
- Javierworks with Steve. - Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
Are you another... janitor at the embassy, like Steve?<br/>
<br/>
No, actually, I'm CIA.<br/>
<br/>
But that's classified, so don't tell anybody.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here to hunt communists and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.<br/>
<br/>
- The janitorthing, what, that was you? - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
No, it's just a cover.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you for being so honest. - Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
Just so you know, I'm a communist guerrillera.<br/>
<br/>
[All chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] If we had known at the time she was telllng the truth...<br/>
<br/>
we probably wouldn't have cared.<br/>
<br/>
We cared about Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
And catchlng him... wasn't gonna be easy.<br/>
<br/>
He had better resources and better information.<br/>
<br/>
And at the time, he owned over 800 homes and fincas,<br/>
<br/>
surrounded by dozens of sicarios willing to die for him.<br/>
<br/>
And cops.... he owned a lot of them, too.<br/>
<br/>
But not all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to surprise him is an aerial as*ault.<br/>
<br/>
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.<br/>
<br/>
Then we need to figure out where he's hiding today.<br/>
<br/>
Trapped a little bird.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Just rememberthat you wanted all in.<br/>
<br/>
[Carrillo in Spanish] Hand me that coffee.<br/>
<br/>
[Man speaks indistinctly in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
[Soft gasp]<br/>
<br/>
[Cup clatters]<br/>
<br/>
[Man gasps sharply, coughs]<br/>
<br/>
[In English] He already gave up the name of three fincas,<br/>
<br/>
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] But you do know where he is hiding, don't you?<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Look, little brother,<br/>
<br/>
I know it scares the shit out of you that Pablo will k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
But I will also k*ll you.<br/>
<br/>
And very slowly.<br/>
<br/>
[Stammers weakly] Pablo is going to k*ll me more slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then, you should pray we find him, and quickly.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] We knew that Escobarwould get a heads-up the second we moved out,<br/>
<br/>
but there was a small part of me that thought, In hls arrogance,<br/>
<br/>
he would stand and fight,<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe we just wanted to send hlm a message.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Boss!<br/>
<br/>
Poison...<br/>
<br/>
Boss!<br/>
<br/>
They were headed for El Bizcocho, but they got off the main highway.<br/>
<br/>
- They're already on theirway here. - How far are they?<br/>
<br/>
Two hours, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Round up the guys, and tell them to get ready.<br/>
<br/>
- We're leaving. - All right.<br/>
<br/>
We have to go.<br/>
<br/>
Go where?<br/>
<br/>
The police are coming.<br/>
<br/>
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours. - I'm sorry, my love,<br/>
<br/>
- but we need to leave now. - What about our things? Our clothes?<br/>
<br/>
We'II buy new ones later, won't we?<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Softly] I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Do you hear me complaining?<br/>
<br/>
As long as you're with us, Pablo, I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.<br/>
<br/>
- Bring all of the boxes here. - [Man] Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Cangrejo! - Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Go to Pablo's room and see if anything is in there.<br/>
<br/>
- Efrain! - Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
The two blue notebooks are the only ones I'm taking.<br/>
<br/>
Search the whole house to make sure that not a single loose document remains.<br/>
<br/>
[Man] Yes, sir!<br/>
<br/>
[Men chatter in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong, Gustavo?<br/>
<br/>
You f*cked us, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Not only you and me.<br/>
<br/>
You f*cked the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
But of course, since you needed to present yourself to Congress...<br/>
<br/>
since you want to be president of this f*ck country,<br/>
<br/>
the rest of us get screwed, isn't that right?<br/>
<br/>
But what the f*ck...<br/>
<br/>
a man only dies once, right?<br/>
<br/>
[Softly] Come here.<br/>
<br/>
[Whispers] My brother.<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo] I'm going to let you sit next to the pilot. Come on, come on.<br/>
<br/>
- [Engine powering] - There we go.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] I llke to think that as Pablo looked down<br/>
<br/>
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,<br/>
<br/>
he got our message... and I hope it really pissed him off,<br/>
<br/>
You may have 800 houses, my friend, but none of them Is home.<br/>
<br/>
We will keep you on the run forthe rest of your life,<br/>
<br/>
or until we catch you... or klll you.<br/>
<br/>
From now on, nowhere Is safe.<br/>
<br/>
[Overlapping chatter in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] The only people to detaln were the malds and the gardeners<br/>
<br/>
whlle we searched the finca from top to bottom.<br/>
<br/>
The dlrt-poorcops were astounded by the luxury.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, if you're risking your llfe for $22 a week.... You'd plg out, too.<br/>
<br/>
There's an old saying In law enforcement:<br/>
<br/>
''The bad guys need to get lucky every tlme.<br/>
<br/>
The good guys just need to get lucky once.""<br/>
<br/>
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit, I got very lucky.<br/>
<br/>
The address I found led us to a nondescrlpt building in downtown Medellín.<br/>
<br/>
We raided it, and guess who we found?<br/>
<br/>
Blackbeard.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's numberone accountant and keeper of all secrets.<br/>
<br/>
In custody, he would describe a cocaine empire<br/>
<br/>
that was bringing in $60 mlllion a day.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain of evldence filled an entlre room in the Palace of Justice,<br/>
<br/>
home of Colombia's supreme court,<br/>
<br/>
the only place thought safe enough to store it,<br/>
<br/>
We had enough evidence to put him away for 100 lifetimes,<br/>
<br/>
[whispers in Spanish] f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
[Whispers in English] f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up? - Jaramillo's running the show.<br/>
<br/>
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.<br/>
<br/>
He's not letting us make any copies of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Javi, there's some good stuff in here, stuff we can use.<br/>
<br/>
[Javier] None of it can leave the room.<br/>
<br/>
The narcos have been paying some guy named Ellis McPickle<br/>
<br/>
- to run coke all overthe place. - Ellis McPickle?<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] I'm assuming that it's an alias.<br/>
<br/>
Take 'em.<br/>
<br/>
- What? - Just stuff'em down your pants.<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
[Whispers] Do you want to catch Pablo or not? [clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
- [Softly] Why me? - [Whispers] Because they'll suspect me.<br/>
<br/>
- They won't suspect you. - What if they search me?<br/>
<br/>
They're not gonna search a white boy, OK?<br/>
<br/>
- You're a guest in their country. - Guests don't steal.<br/>
<br/>
Just do it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you gotta do bad things to catch bad people.<br/>
<br/>
- [Steve] And sometimes, bad people,,, - Senor.<br/>
<br/>
... help you do good things.<br/>
<br/>
[Javier in Spanish] These are from the narcos' account in Miami.<br/>
<br/>
A cashier's check payable to ""Ellis McPickle.""<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that name mentioned in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, it's an alias.<br/>
<br/>
No Colombian would go by the name ""Ellis McPickle."" [soft chuckle]<br/>
<br/>
Because he's not Colombian.<br/>
<br/>
He's an American pilot who transports tons of cocaine for the cartel.<br/>
<br/>
- A gringo? - Mm-hm.<br/>
<br/>
- What's his name? - We don't know.<br/>
<br/>
But we do know that Gustavo frequently mentions ""McPickle.""<br/>
<br/>
Suarez, do you ever worry what will happen to you<br/>
<br/>
if Pablo finds out that you work for both sides?<br/>
<br/>
- I'm on your side. - Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Then prove it. What else can you tell me about McPickle?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
We have his photograph in some of ourfiles.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe you should check with the CIA. He started his career with them.<br/>
<br/>
[Chats indistinctly in Spanish, chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Wha... What the f*ck is this?<br/>
<br/>
This is me giving you homework.<br/>
<br/>
Former CIA pilot flying coke forthe narcos.<br/>
<br/>
And I need you to find out who it is.<br/>
<br/>
First off, I don't f*cking work for you, Murphy, you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
- So don't come in here thinking that... - Is that Barry Seal?<br/>
<br/>
What's he up to these days?<br/>
<br/>
Barry Seal.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Barry Seal, a good ol' Southern boy who loved college football,<br/>
<br/>
mind-altering chemicals, and p*ssy...<br/>
<br/>
which made him perfect CIA material.<br/>
<br/>
But his expensive llfestyle also made him perfect narco material,<br/>
<br/>
Findlng Barry was easy.<br/>
<br/>
Wejust had to stake out hls favorlte whorehouse.<br/>
<br/>
It just so happened to be Pena's favorite, too.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine told me about this place. I've never been here before.<br/>
<br/>
[Laughing]<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm serious.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Look.<br/>
<br/>
[Javier] Oh, my God. That's Freckles. I know her.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Until next time.<br/>
<br/>
- [In English] g*dd*mn, is that Barry? - Or should we say McPickle?<br/>
<br/>
Come on, we got you a ride waiting over here.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] Hi, Vanessa.<br/>
<br/>
[In English] It's fun to say, though, ain't it? ""McPickle""?<br/>
<br/>
[Javier clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
Have a seat, Barry.<br/>
<br/>
You seem awful relaxed for someone who's facing life in the clink.<br/>
<br/>
- Well, you guys ain't got shit. - [Javier chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
We got records from Escobar listing shipments from Medellín to Louisiana<br/>
<br/>
- to the tune of 500 tons? - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? Well, let's see if that holds up in court, huh?<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is you can't make a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana<br/>
<br/>
without making a refueling stop.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, according to the records, you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.<br/>
<br/>
The manifests don't lie.<br/>
<br/>
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist countries with orwithout cocaine,<br/>
<br/>
that would be considered treason by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Well, damn... [chuckles] You guys are good.<br/>
<br/>
Communist sympathizer.<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna wrap you up in a big, red bow<br/>
<br/>
and drop you right off at Reagan's doorstep.<br/>
<br/>
Using Cuba and Nicaragua as refueling stops for coke shipments,<br/>
<br/>
that's treason and tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
What's that, two life sentences forthe price of one?<br/>
<br/>
[Javier] That's right.<br/>
<br/>
Well... see, lfigured this day might come.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you uncuff me, boys. I got something to show you.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? What's that?<br/>
<br/>
It's what I call a ""get out of jail free"" card.<br/>
<br/>
Y'all gonna wanna see this. Come on, uncuff me.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] What Barry had was a plcture of Escobar<br/>
<br/>
loading cocalne on a tarmac in Nlcaragua. Why does that matter?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was governed by the communist Sandinistas,<br/>
<br/>
who were letting Escobar use theircountry as a landing strip<br/>
<br/>
forcocalne shipments to the US,<br/>
<br/>
Colombian cocaine coming through a communlst country and into Amerlca?<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't have made that up.<br/>
<br/>
- [Javier] Holy shit. - [Steve] It was too good,<br/>
<br/>
- Gotta turn this overto the ambassador. - Wait, wait, wait. No.<br/>
<br/>
This leaks wide and Barry Seal is a d*ad man. We gotta be careful.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag who's tr*ffick over 500 tons?<br/>
<br/>
I have a code of ethics when it comes to informants.<br/>
<br/>
But not when it comes to torturing suspects with hot coffee.<br/>
<br/>
- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo. - Why is that?<br/>
<br/>
You had a partner k*ll. He's had a dozen.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] I always admired Pena's commitment to Informants,<br/>
<br/>
but frankly, Barry Seal wasn't an informant.<br/>
<br/>
He was just another busted tr*ffick<br/>
<br/>
who ratted on the guys he worked wlth... a snitch.<br/>
<br/>
If I could use the narco-communist connectlon<br/>
<br/>
to get the resources we needed, then f*ck hlm.<br/>
<br/>
Strange bedfellows, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
You have single-handedly exposed a narco-communist connection.<br/>
<br/>
Washington is gonna go crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
This has to be highly classified forthe safety of the informant.<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] In Washington, ""highly classlfied"" dldn't carry much water.<br/>
<br/>
Especially when a Marlne colonel named Ollver North got his hands on the plcture.<br/>
<br/>
I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem<br/>
<br/>
will be outraged to learn that top Nicaraguan government officials<br/>
<br/>
are deeply involved in drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
This picture shows Federico Vaughan,<br/>
<br/>
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes who rule Nicaragua,<br/>
<br/>
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics bound for the United States.<br/>
<br/>
No, there seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Being a rat is a dangerous business,<br/>
<br/>
and Escobar's reach was long.<br/>
<br/>
Barry Seal refused federal protection,,,<br/>
<br/>
- [a*t*matic g*n] - [Grunts]<br/>
<br/>
...and met his end in a parking lot In Baton Rouge.<br/>
<br/>
Whoops.<br/>
<br/>
f*ck! I told you we had to be careful.<br/>
<br/>
- You got Barry Seal k*ll. - Pena, if he wanted a long life,<br/>
<br/>
- he should've worked at Kodak. - You're responsible for his death.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't k*ll him, Escobar did.<br/>
<br/>
Now we can go afterthat f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
Look on the bright side, man.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] From then on, according to Reagan,<br/>
<br/>
fighting the narcos was the same as fighting the commles.<br/>
<br/>
We got a tldal wave of money and all the resources we needed.<br/>
<br/>
The US Southern Command in Panama sent us a care package.<br/>
<br/>
Planes, helicopters, you f*cking name it. Everything.<br/>
<br/>
Our resources and intel helped the Colombians raid labs all overthe country<br/>
<br/>
and burn 'em straight to the ground, selzlng over a billion dollars in coke.<br/>
<br/>
We were kicking ass, and the narcos were feeling it.<br/>
<br/>
The price of cocaine in Miami was skyrocketing.<br/>
<br/>
Despite all this, we'd yet to net one of the Medellín kingpins...<br/>
<br/>
till we put a tracking devlce on a Colombian-bound shlpment of ether,<br/>
<br/>
the essential ingredient In cocaine processlng.<br/>
<br/>
Got it!<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] The barrel that we tracked brought us to Tranqullandla,<br/>
<br/>
Medellín's biggest processing lab, and we hit It hard.<br/>
<br/>
The ensuing g*n battle cost dozens of men...<br/>
<br/>
but in the end, it got us our blggest victory to date,<br/>
<br/>
the first of the Medellln klngpins: Carlos Lehder.<br/>
<br/>
[In English] In my tent is a bag with $50,000...<br/>
<br/>
ten times this if you give me one hour.<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] There's no way out, Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] Lehderwas immediately extradited to the States,<br/>
<br/>
where a federal court sentenced hlm to life... plus 135 years.<br/>
<br/>
Extradition worked. Carlos wlll die in an American jail,<br/>
<br/>
And no one savored thls victory more than the Colomblans.<br/>
<br/>
For anti-narco candldate Luis Carlos Galán,<br/>
<br/>
it would provlde hlm the momentum he needed to propel hlm to the presidency,<br/>
<br/>
Extradition would become his battle cry.<br/>
<br/>
[Man in Spanish] Gentlemen?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] And forthe narcos, thls was a declaratlon of w*r.<br/>
<br/>
[Duque in Spanish] What happened to Carlos was terrible.<br/>
<br/>
But I have already presented a motion before the Supreme Court of Colombia<br/>
<br/>
against the legality of extradition.<br/>
<br/>
They are examining it this week at the Palace of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
Can we buy someone in that court?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, no.<br/>
<br/>
It's the only institution in this country that is incorruptible.<br/>
<br/>
Let's pray that the ruling comes out in ourfavor.<br/>
<br/>
Brother... even after he's d*ad,<br/>
<br/>
Carlos still has a sentence of 135 years in prison.<br/>
<br/>
He's totally f*cked.<br/>
<br/>
This is gringo bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
That happened to him for speaking about the revolution on the radio.<br/>
<br/>
We're next, aren't we?<br/>
<br/>
You're right.<br/>
<br/>
Pablito?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an answer or what?<br/>
<br/>
Well... in my opinion, a jail in the United States is worse than death.<br/>
<br/>
We can neverforget what happened to Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
Carlos was one of us.<br/>
<br/>
Fabio is right. The Americans are f*cking us.<br/>
<br/>
But remember, there's something they want more than us.<br/>
<br/>
So, brothers...<br/>
<br/>
it's time to give them what they want, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
[Murmurs of approval]<br/>
<br/>
[Ivan in Spanish] I didn't think our paths would cross again.<br/>
<br/>
What you want isn't going to be easy. It's very risky.<br/>
<br/>
It's going to require w*apon and men. There will be casualties.<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you want. How much are we talking about?<br/>
<br/>
Two million US dollars.<br/>
<br/>
It's very dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting a revolution comes with sacrifice...<br/>
<br/>
and it goes without saying that it will dangerous, right?<br/>
<br/>
[Knocking at door]<br/>
<br/>
[Pablo] But for us, brother...<br/>
<br/>
it is our duty to fight to the very end.<br/>
<br/>
We have a historical obligation.<br/>
<br/>
- We can't forget that. - [Indistinct chatter in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
[Elisa] I'm his girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
Meet Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Miss.<br/>
<br/>
- OK. - We have a deal.<br/>
<br/>
All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
We were just leaving.<br/>
<br/>
Good night.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell is this?<br/>
<br/>
Why are you meeting with Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
We made a deal... obviously for money.<br/>
<br/>
In exchange for what?<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are willing to be part of it, I cannot say.<br/>
<br/>
It's a partnership, necessary forthe revolutionary fight.<br/>
<br/>
I fight for the people... not for drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
[In English] Connie?<br/>
<br/>
Elisa? What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
- I need to talk to you. - About what?<br/>
<br/>
You told me your husband works at the embassy.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to speak with him and warn him.<br/>
<br/>
About what?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar is planning something with a communist group called the M-19.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what it is, but I know it's gonna be bad.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, Pablo Escobar? How do you know anything about Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
L... I just know. You need to warn him...<br/>
<br/>
and you need to hide me.<br/>
<br/>
OK. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Steve's already at work, but Javi lives downstairs.<br/>
<br/>
I just hope he's here.<br/>
<br/>
[Javier] I am.<br/>
<br/>
- Well, what have we here? - I'll explain later.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right back. Go.<br/>
<br/>
- [Connie] She told me that Escobar,,, - Slow down.<br/>
<br/>
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks they're gonna do something terrlble.<br/>
<br/>
- Slow down. - Escobar is uslng members of M-19.<br/>
<br/>
- Say that again? - Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.<br/>
<br/>
Escobarand M-19?<br/>
<br/>
She dldn't tellme any details, just that It would be bad.<br/>
<br/>
No... that doesn't make any sense.<br/>
<br/>
She asked me to hide her, so I took her to Javl's apartment.<br/>
<br/>
OK. All right.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs, clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
- Agent Murphy! - All right.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador, I got information with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...<br/>
<br/>
- [reporter] ... supreme court building. - Oh, my God.<br/>
<br/>
[Steve] ""Oh, my God''is right.<br/>
<br/>
Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas stormed the Palace ofJustlce<br/>
<br/>
and occupled the supreme court.<br/>
<br/>
They took over 100 hostages and made a bunch of demands<br/>
<br/>
about the redistribution of wealth and an end to injustice and tyranny...<br/>
<br/>
but it was all bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
The military attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Dozens of lives were lost in the camage,<br/>
<br/>
including half of Colombia's supreme court justices.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the M-19 were k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
Some escaped... but not before accompllshing theirtrue goal.<br/>
<br/>
Settlng f*re to the room that contained 600,000 pages of evldence agalnst Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
The entire case against him turned to ash.<br/>
<br/>
In the Unlted States, the Mafla makes wltnesses disappear<br/>
<br/>
so they can't testify in court.<br/>
<br/>
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar made the whole court disappear.<br/>
<br/>
[Reporter] The fires set by guerrillas earller in the day grew even stronger<br/>
<br/>
as cannon shells exploded inside.<br/>
<br/>
[Ioud knock at door]<br/>
<br/>
[Pounding at door]<br/>
<br/>
- Where is she? - Well, come on in.<br/>
<br/>
You, up! Who in the f*ck is she and why is the military after her?<br/>
<br/>
Put the g*n away.<br/>
<br/>
Put it away.<br/>
<br/>
She told me who she is. Put the g*n away.<br/>
<br/>
- Can I say something? - No, you may not.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy... calm down.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why you'd get yourself involved in this.<br/>
<br/>
Your wife brought herto me.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you putting yourself out there for my wife, I truly do,<br/>
<br/>
but why are we risking our whole careers overthis woman?<br/>
<br/>
Because she can prove that Pablo was behind the palace siege.<br/>
<br/>
If she can tie Escobarto the siege, I say we bring her in.<br/>
<br/>
Well, she's M-19.<br/>
<br/>
Noonan would have to turn her over to the Colombian military<br/>
<br/>
and then she gets disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to avoid another Barry Seal situation.<br/>
<br/>
So we're gonna harbor a communist fugitive?<br/>
<br/>
Look, all she did was warn us.<br/>
<br/>
She's not on anybody's radar.<br/>
<br/>
She's not involved in anything.<br/>
<br/>
The red X's you see in these pictures indicate M-19 revolutionaries<br/>
<br/>
terminated by the Oolombian Special Forces.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining individuals you see are fugitives.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, this is more complicated than what it seems.<br/>
<br/>
This was Escobar, classic. He's cut a deal with M-19.<br/>
<br/>
Next you'll tell us Escobar sank the Titanic.<br/>
<br/>
Was it coincidence the extradition evidence against him was destroyed?<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't hold grudges, not if it suits his purposes.<br/>
<br/>
- How do you know he cut a deal? - We have a confidential informant.<br/>
<br/>
You willing to identify this informant, Agent Pena?<br/>
<br/>
- No, I am not. - Needless to say...<br/>
<br/>
Southern Command has rescinded its offer of resources to the DEA<br/>
<br/>
in light of this communist aggression.<br/>
<br/>
We need to target the M-19 leadership:<br/>
<br/>
Ivan ""the Terrible"" Torres and Elisa Alvarez.<br/>
<br/>
[Low murmurs in Spanish]<br/>
<br/>
[In Spanish] They're looking for us everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
What did you expect?<br/>
<br/>
That it would be any different?<br/>
<br/>
You did a very good job.<br/>
<br/>
You can't imagine how much this is going to help our cause.<br/>
<br/>
No, brother. The truth is, you helped mine.<br/>
<br/>
You, Ivan...<br/>
<br/>
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.<br/>
<br/>
The same one that freed this country.<br/>
<br/>
Now it belongs to you.<br/>
<br/>
With it, you will continue the fight... to free this country.<br/>
<br/>
I promise you, I will continue the fight.<br/>
<br/>
You earned it, brother.<br/>
<br/>
As for me...<br/>
<br/>
I'II be in Panama until this blows over.<br/>
<br/>
We are also...<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you grab the briefcase.<br/>

[Classic Latin pop song plays]</div>]","[Iow, indistinct chatter]

[Men laughing]

Murphy, join the party, huh?

What's wrong?

All you guys having a good time?

You gotta let it go, man. There's good that came out of this.

Yeah, we used him, then we got him k*ll.

No, we didn't k*ll him... Escobar did.

And now we get to go after that f*ck.

- Look on the bright side, huh? - [Slaps Steve's back]

[Steve] Pena was right. There was a sllverlinlng.

One of the sicarios caught after Lara Bonilla's assasslnatlon

confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

An important politician had been m*rder and everyone knew who dld lt.

Finally, the Colombian government had to react.

Pablo Escobarwas indicted forthe m*rder Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA $100,000 REWARD

Colombia agreed to the one thlng narcos feared most. Extradition.

Now any Colombian who smuggled drugs to America

could be prosecuted and jalled in the US,

even if they never stepped foot on our soil.

This made all the dlfference in the world.

- [Latin music plays nearby] - If you were a narco In Colombla,

jall time meant banging girls, watching movies,

hanging with the fellas...

Grease the right hands and you'd get a reduced sentence for good behavlor.

It was a f*cking joke,

Back home, it was a whole dlfferent deal.

The seventh richest man in the world? No one glves a shit.

You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day, just like every other loser,

a f*cking nightmare,

Now Pablo had someone to fear: Us.

[Latin guitartheme music plays]

Extradition doesn't mean anything unless you can catch him.

- With our help, you will. - Oh, that's right.

Gringos to the rescue.

[Dry chuckle] It's one f*cking man against the United States of America.

One man with helicopters, airplanes, vehicles, planned escape routes,

- and a network of informants. - Our government will provide money,

- men, w*apon... - You make it sound so easy.

But Escobar has always managed to stay one step ahead of us.

Help us catch him.

I'll never be assigned to this. Jaramillo hates my guts.

Let me take care of that.

- You think extradition's a victory. - It is.

Escobarwill not go lightly.

He will make Colombia bleed.

[In Spanish] Now more than ever is the time for solidarity.

You make the mistakes, and then you preach solidarity?

- Shut up, f*g. - What the f*ck, Carlos?

Why are you always defending him?

Did he get your sister back for you or not?

We rescued her because we did it together. Right?

Gentlemen...

I suggest we form anotherorganization

to fight against the injustice of extradition.

Like John Lennon said,

- ""Come together, brothers and sisters...'' - Stop that f*g shit right now.

So Jorge...

what will we call it?

[Steve] First, ''Death to Kidnappers,'' then ""the Extradltables.''

Once again, the narcos were united agalnst a common enemy. Jail In America.

But it was not quite like ""one forall, and all forone.""

It was more like each man for himself.

[In Spanish] Next!

Gacha, being Gacha, declded that all he had to do to defeat extradltlon

- was k*ll anyone who tried to arrest him. - [Man] f*re!

[Steve] So he hired a bunch of Israelimercenaries and prepared for w*r.

Next!

Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite and took to the alrwaves.

[In Spanish] The gringos are the ones who use the drugs.

So why are we the ones who need to be extradited?

[Steve] I'm not sure how helpful that was.

[Carlos] I mean, all of our problems...

are because of those imperialist gringos!

[Sniffs] No, stay there... stay there.

[Steve] As forthe Ochoa brothers, they went with a fancy PR flrm

and got ripped off because, well... that's what PR agencies do.

[In Spanish] ""Better a grave in Oolombia

than a grave in the United States.""

No, I've got t, Fabio, I've got it. Let's see...

""Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the United States.""

- What do you think? - I love it.

- [Jorge chuckling] - Very good.

And for $50,000 more, we'll make your logo.

Done.

[Steve] By the way, here's the logo $50,000 got you.

In the upcoming presidential election, extradltion became the defining Issue

amongst the candidates.

Those the narcos could buy, they bought.

The ones they could scare, they scared.

But Luis Carlos Galán was nelther.

And so, unable to buy him and unable to scare him,

Escobar tried out that fancy new statlonery,

and he wrote Galán a letter.

[In English] ""And to conclude, I want to express my most energetic protest

over the improper interference of North America

n a way that entails the most flagrant violation

of the sovereignty of our Motherland.""

He's got some balls.

Escobar is shameless.

The United States is inclined to support your bid forthe presidency, Mr. Galán.

But even if we indict these narcos in the United States,

we still can't get them there without Colombian approval.

We're curious as to your view on extradition.

My campaign manager, Dr. Gaviria,

doesn't want me to stick my foot in my mouth.

America wants Pablo Escobar to prove they're winning a battle,

when clearly, they're losing a w*r.

I'll do what's best forColombia.

[In Spanish] If you speak in favor of extradition, you will be their puppet,

and that will be your death sentence.

I don't care about the Americans, but I am still going to support extradition.

Besides, if the gringos want to take away all the g*dd*mn k*ll of this country,

then let them take them.

[Steve] Slnce he couldn't get to Galán,

Pablo reached out to many of the country's judges.

He figured out that a sanctioned law would do no harm

if no judge was willing to apply it.

""As you pass judgment on one of our sons

and considersending him to hls fate in the Unlted States,

know we, the Extraditables, wlll pass judgment on you

and bring a sentence far harsher.""

The judges were so scared and Intimidated

that special court procedures had to be created.

For the first time in the history of Colombia,

it was the good guys who had to hide thelrfaces behlnd the masks.

[In Spanish] Defendants, please rise.

You've been tried and convicted of cocaine tr*ffick.

You will immediately be turned over to the DEA for extradition to the United States.

[Steve] Despite hls thr*at, many brave men defled hlm.

And true to form, when the pen failed...

Pablo was always ready with the sword.

[Engine starts]

In light of this terrorism, you'd thlnk that everyone in Colombla

would've made catching Escobar the numberone prlorlty, rlght?

Well, guess again,

Communists. They're the real thr*at to the security of this country.

All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has k*ll more Americans than Soviet troops.

We got FARC, we got M-19, we got EPL, we got ELN,

all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

Sorry, Agent Pena, but our resources gotta be directed at America's problems,

and you don't get to tell us what those are.

[Steve] Communlsts. Rememberthem?

With Reagan in the White House, it was hard to forget,

In his words.

They are the focus of evil in the modern world.

[Steve] The Soviet evll empire was Reagan's thing, always had been.

In Hollywood, he named some actors as communist sympathlzers.

In Washington, he created the Reagan Doctrine,

which opposed Soviet-backed communists all overthe world.

Drug tr*ffick just dldn't rate.

You want to turn on the tap of the rlchest country in the world,

you'd better be chasing reds.

Ambassador, if the CIA and the Mil Group provide assets,

the Colombians will get Escobar.

We're talking about a huge blow to the cocaine trade

- and saving thousands of lives... - Ambassador.

The CIA agrees with Mil Group. Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

He's just a wanted Colombian drug tr*ffick, and as such,

he is not a direct thr*at to our country's strategic interests in South America.

The CIA would prefer not to get involved in local police problems.

Let the Colombians get him.

Noonan really thinks allocating $100,000

- will be enough to go after Escobar. - Yeah, it's a f*cking joke.

That's about what he spends on shoes, isn't it?

The CNP has zero chance of capturing him with that bullshit.

So what do we do now?

Use what little we got to try to even the odds.

[Steve] It's true, the hundred grand wasn't that much.

But delivered into the right hands, it could make a difference.

There were a lot of good cops in Colombia, honorable men.

But the head of counternarcotics, General Jaramlllo, wasn't one of'em,

And as such, he was exactly what we needed.

[In Spanish] Thank you for seeing me, General.

You're welcome.

Listen, I have General Gomez assigned to the operation against Pablo.

With all due respect, General Jaramillo... I propose Horacio Carrillo.

But Carrillo only acts on his own orders. He doesn't follow anyone.

Well, I don't want him to follow.

I want him to lead.

Go ahead.

Yes, General.

As you wish.

Understood.

What happened, honey?

Things with work.

When will Horacio arrive to have dinnerwith us?

I'm making the chicken he likes, but he's out with the girlfriend.

Tell me what's wrong.

They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

They're saying that since you've become a wanted man,

bribing the police has gotten very costly.

They want to renegotiate the price of our routes.

[Pablo] Hm.

When it came to me k*ll to get their sister back, well, then...

I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

Yeah. The problem is that it is one thing to k*ll communists

- and anotherto k*ll politicians. - So what now?

What I would do is increase the payments to the police, you know?

And most of all, to the top brass.

We're already giving too much money to those bastards.

[Gustavo] Mm.

Oh, shit. What's that? Is it snowing orwhat?

- [Birds squawking] - [Pablo] Egrets from the Himalayas.

[Gustavo chuckles]

It took two years to train them to stay there.

They cost me a million dollars.

[Sighs]

Bastards.

Stay in the f*cking tree!

[Gustavo laughs]

Seems like you lost that dough, eh, cousin?

That's your problem, Pablo.

You think that everything can be controlled,

but it turns out that nature cannot be controlled.

OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK. [sighs]

Your English is really good.

Thank you. I took a course at the University of Antioquia.

How long you been at the comuna?

Just a few weeks.

Is your husband gonna help us here, too?

I saw him when he dropped you off. What does he do?

Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial services at the US Embassy.

[Up-tempo Latin music plays]

- I f*cked up. - How?

Carrillo got the job just like you wanted.

No, Jaramillo's sending a message.

He's telling me I got his price wrong.

He's setting Carrillo up forfailure, and when he does fail,

he'll f*re him for incompetence,

and me and you, we lose the only cop we can trust.

[Women chuckling]

- Hey! - Hey!

- Sorry I'm late, honey. - Mm...

Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.

- Javierworks with Steve. - Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Are you another... janitor at the embassy, like Steve?

No, actually, I'm CIA.

But that's classified, so don't tell anybody.

I'm here to hunt communists and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

- The janitorthing, what, that was you? - Mm.

No, it's just a cover.

- Thank you for being so honest. - Mm-hm.

Just so you know, I'm a communist guerrillera.

[All chuckling]

Perfect.

[Steve] If we had known at the time she was telllng the truth...

we probably wouldn't have cared.

We cared about Pablo Escobar.

And catchlng him... wasn't gonna be easy.

He had better resources and better information.

And at the time, he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

surrounded by dozens of sicarios willing to die for him.

And cops.... he owned a lot of them, too.

But not all of them.

Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

The only way to surprise him is an aerial as*ault.

Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

Then we need to figure out where he's hiding today.

Trapped a little bird.

And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

Jesus.

Just rememberthat you wanted all in.

[Carrillo in Spanish] Hand me that coffee.

[Man speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

[Soft gasp]

[Cup clatters]

[Man gasps sharply, coughs]

[In English] He already gave up the name of three fincas,

but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

[In Spanish] But you do know where he is hiding, don't you?

[In Spanish] Look, little brother,

I know it scares the shit out of you that Pablo will k*ll you.

But I will also k*ll you.

And very slowly.

[Stammers weakly] Pablo is going to k*ll me more slowly.

Well, then, you should pray we find him, and quickly.

[Steve] We knew that Escobarwould get a heads-up the second we moved out,

but there was a small part of me that thought, In hls arrogance,

he would stand and fight,

Or maybe we just wanted to send hlm a message.

[In Spanish] Boss!

Poison...

Boss!

They were headed for El Bizcocho, but they got off the main highway.

- They're already on theirway here. - How far are they?

Two hours, boss.

Round up the guys, and tell them to get ready.

- We're leaving. - All right.

We have to go.

Go where?

The police are coming.

- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours. - I'm sorry, my love,

- but we need to leave now. - What about our things? Our clothes?

We'II buy new ones later, won't we?

[Pablo sighs]

[Softly] I'm sorry.

Do you hear me complaining?

As long as you're with us, Pablo, I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

- Bring all of the boxes here. - [Man] Yes, sir.

- Cangrejo! - Yes?

Go to Pablo's room and see if anything is in there.

- Efrain! - Yeah?

The two blue notebooks are the only ones I'm taking.

Search the whole house to make sure that not a single loose document remains.

[Man] Yes, sir!

[Men chatter in Spanish]

What's wrong, Gustavo?

You f*cked us, Pablo.

Not only you and me.

You f*cked the whole family.

But of course, since you needed to present yourself to Congress...

since you want to be president of this f*ck country,

the rest of us get screwed, isn't that right?

But what the f*ck...

a man only dies once, right?

[Softly] Come here.

[Whispers] My brother.

[Pablo] I'm going to let you sit next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

- [Engine powering] - There we go.

[Steve] I llke to think that as Pablo looked down

on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,

he got our message... and I hope it really pissed him off,

You may have 800 houses, my friend, but none of them Is home.

We will keep you on the run forthe rest of your life,

or until we catch you... or klll you.

From now on, nowhere Is safe.

[Overlapping chatter in Spanish]

[Steve] The only people to detaln were the malds and the gardeners

whlle we searched the finca from top to bottom.

The dlrt-poorcops were astounded by the luxury.

Hey, if you're risking your llfe for $22 a week.... You'd plg out, too.

There's an old saying In law enforcement:

''The bad guys need to get lucky every tlme.

The good guys just need to get lucky once.""

And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit, I got very lucky.

The address I found led us to a nondescrlpt building in downtown Medellín.

We raided it, and guess who we found?

Blackbeard.

Pablo's numberone accountant and keeper of all secrets.

In custody, he would describe a cocaine empire

that was bringing in $60 mlllion a day.

Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

The mountain of evldence filled an entlre room in the Palace of Justice,

home of Colombia's supreme court,

the only place thought safe enough to store it,

We had enough evidence to put him away for 100 lifetimes,

[whispers in Spanish] f*ck.

[Whispers in English] f*ck.

- What's up? - Jaramillo's running the show.

He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

He's not letting us make any copies of anything.

Javi, there's some good stuff in here, stuff we can use.

[Javier] None of it can leave the room.

The narcos have been paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

- to run coke all overthe place. - Ellis McPickle?

[Steve] I'm assuming that it's an alias.

Take 'em.

- What? - Just stuff'em down your pants.

What are you talking about?

[Whispers] Do you want to catch Pablo or not? [clears throat]

- [Softly] Why me? - [Whispers] Because they'll suspect me.

- They won't suspect you. - What if they search me?

They're not gonna search a white boy, OK?

- You're a guest in their country. - Guests don't steal.

Just do it.

Sometimes you gotta do bad things to catch bad people.

- [Steve] And sometimes, bad people,,, - Senor.

... help you do good things.

[Javier in Spanish] These are from the narcos' account in Miami.

A cashier's check payable to ""Ellis McPickle.""

Yes.

I've heard that name mentioned in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

Obviously, it's an alias.

No Colombian would go by the name ""Ellis McPickle."" [soft chuckle]

Because he's not Colombian.

He's an American pilot who transports tons of cocaine for the cartel.

- A gringo? - Mm-hm.

- What's his name? - We don't know.

But we do know that Gustavo frequently mentions ""McPickle.""

Suarez, do you ever worry what will happen to you

if Pablo finds out that you work for both sides?

- I'm on your side. - Yeah?

Then prove it. What else can you tell me about McPickle?

[Sighs]

We have his photograph in some of ourfiles.

But maybe you should check with the CIA. He started his career with them.

[Chats indistinctly in Spanish, chuckles]

Wha... What the f*ck is this?

This is me giving you homework.

Former CIA pilot flying coke forthe narcos.

And I need you to find out who it is.

First off, I don't f*cking work for you, Murphy, you hear me?

- So don't come in here thinking that... - Is that Barry Seal?

What's he up to these days?

Barry Seal.

[Steve] Barry Seal, a good ol' Southern boy who loved college football,

mind-altering chemicals, and p*ssy...

which made him perfect CIA material.

But his expensive llfestyle also made him perfect narco material,

Findlng Barry was easy.

Wejust had to stake out hls favorlte whorehouse.

It just so happened to be Pena's favorite, too.

A friend of mine told me about this place. I've never been here before.

[Laughing]

No, I'm serious.

[Steve] Look.

[Javier] Oh, my God. That's Freckles. I know her.

[In Spanish] Until next time.

- [In English] g*dd*mn, is that Barry? - Or should we say McPickle?

Come on, we got you a ride waiting over here.

[In Spanish] Hi, Vanessa.

[In English] It's fun to say, though, ain't it? ""McPickle""?

[Javier clears throat]

Have a seat, Barry.

You seem awful relaxed for someone who's facing life in the clink.

- Well, you guys ain't got shit. - [Javier chuckles]

We got records from Escobar listing shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

- to the tune of 500 tons? - Yeah.

Yeah? Well, let's see if that holds up in court, huh?

The funny thing is you can't make a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

without making a refueling stop.

Yeah, according to the records, you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

The manifests don't lie.

An ex-CIA man making stops in communist countries with orwithout cocaine,

that would be considered treason by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?

Well, damn... [chuckles] You guys are good.

Communist sympathizer.

We're gonna wrap you up in a big, red bow

and drop you right off at Reagan's doorstep.

Using Cuba and Nicaragua as refueling stops for coke shipments,

that's treason and tr*ffick.

What's that, two life sentences forthe price of one?

[Javier] That's right.

Well... see, lfigured this day might come.

Why don't you uncuff me, boys. I got something to show you.

Yeah? What's that?

It's what I call a ""get out of jail free"" card.

Y'all gonna wanna see this. Come on, uncuff me.

[Steve] What Barry had was a plcture of Escobar

loading cocalne on a tarmac in Nlcaragua. Why does that matter?

'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was governed by the communist Sandinistas,

who were letting Escobar use theircountry as a landing strip

forcocalne shipments to the US,

Colombian cocaine coming through a communlst country and into Amerlca?

I couldn't have made that up.

- [Javier] Holy shit. - [Steve] It was too good,

- Gotta turn this overto the ambassador. - Wait, wait, wait. No.

This leaks wide and Barry Seal is a d*ad man. We gotta be careful.

Why are you trying to protect some scumbag who's tr*ffick over 500 tons?

I have a code of ethics when it comes to informants.

But not when it comes to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo. - Why is that?

You had a partner k*ll. He's had a dozen.

[Steve] I always admired Pena's commitment to Informants,

but frankly, Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

He was just another busted tr*ffick

who ratted on the guys he worked wlth... a snitch.

If I could use the narco-communist connectlon

to get the resources we needed, then f*ck hlm.

Strange bedfellows, indeed.

You have single-handedly exposed a narco-communist connection.

Washington is gonna go crazy.

Thank you, Ambassador.

This has to be highly classified forthe safety of the informant.

Of course.

Thank you.

[Steve] In Washington, ""highly classlfied"" dldn't carry much water.

Especially when a Marlne colonel named Ollver North got his hands on the plcture.

I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem

will be outraged to learn that top Nicaraguan government officials

are deeply involved in drug tr*ffick.

This picture shows Federico Vaughan,

a top aide to one of the nine comandantes who rule Nicaragua,

loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics bound for the United States.

No, there seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

[Steve] Being a rat is a dangerous business,

and Escobar's reach was long.

Barry Seal refused federal protection,,,

- [a*t*matic g*n] - [Grunts]

...and met his end in a parking lot In Baton Rouge.

Whoops.

f*ck! I told you we had to be careful.

- You got Barry Seal k*ll. - Pena, if he wanted a long life,

- he should've worked at Kodak. - You're responsible for his death.

I didn't k*ll him, Escobar did.

Now we can go afterthat f*ck.

Look on the bright side, man.

[Steve] From then on, according to Reagan,

fighting the narcos was the same as fighting the commles.

We got a tldal wave of money and all the resources we needed.

The US Southern Command in Panama sent us a care package.

Planes, helicopters, you f*cking name it. Everything.

Our resources and intel helped the Colombians raid labs all overthe country

and burn 'em straight to the ground, selzlng over a billion dollars in coke.

We were kicking ass, and the narcos were feeling it.

The price of cocaine in Miami was skyrocketing.

Despite all this, we'd yet to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

till we put a tracking devlce on a Colombian-bound shlpment of ether,

the essential ingredient In cocaine processlng.

Got it!

[Steve] The barrel that we tracked brought us to Tranqullandla,

Medellín's biggest processing lab, and we hit It hard.

The ensuing g*n battle cost dozens of men...

but in the end, it got us our blggest victory to date,

the first of the Medellln klngpins: Carlos Lehder.

[In English] In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

ten times this if you give me one hour.

[In Spanish] There's no way out, Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

[Steve] Lehderwas immediately extradited to the States,

where a federal court sentenced hlm to life... plus 135 years.

Extradition worked. Carlos wlll die in an American jail,

And no one savored thls victory more than the Colomblans.

For anti-narco candldate Luis Carlos Galán,

it would provlde hlm the momentum he needed to propel hlm to the presidency,

Extradition would become his battle cry.

[Man in Spanish] Gentlemen?

Thank you.

[Steve] And forthe narcos, thls was a declaratlon of w*r.

[Duque in Spanish] What happened to Carlos was terrible.

But I have already presented a motion before the Supreme Court of Colombia

against the legality of extradition.

They are examining it this week at the Palace of Justice.

Can we buy someone in that court?

Unfortunately, no.

It's the only institution in this country that is incorruptible.

Let's pray that the ruling comes out in ourfavor.

Brother... even after he's d*ad,

Carlos still has a sentence of 135 years in prison.

He's totally f*cked.

This is gringo bullshit.

That happened to him for speaking about the revolution on the radio.

We're next, aren't we?

You're right.

Pablito?

Do you have an answer or what?

Well... in my opinion, a jail in the United States is worse than death.

We can neverforget what happened to Carlos.

Carlos was one of us.

Fabio is right. The Americans are f*cking us.

But remember, there's something they want more than us.

So, brothers...

it's time to give them what they want, isn't it?

[Murmurs of approval]

[Ivan in Spanish] I didn't think our paths would cross again.

What you want isn't going to be easy. It's very risky.

It's going to require w*apon and men. There will be casualties.

I understand what you want. How much are we talking about?

Two million US dollars.

It's very dangerous.

Fighting a revolution comes with sacrifice...

and it goes without saying that it will dangerous, right?

[Knocking at door]

[Pablo] But for us, brother...

it is our duty to fight to the very end.

We have a historical obligation.

- We can't forget that. - [Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

[Elisa] I'm his girlfriend.

Meet Pablo Escobar.

Miss.

- OK. - We have a deal.

All right, then.

We were just leaving.

Good night.

What the hell is this?

Why are you meeting with Escobar?

We made a deal... obviously for money.

In exchange for what?

Unless you are willing to be part of it, I cannot say.

It's a partnership, necessary forthe revolutionary fight.

I fight for the people... not for drug tr*ffick.

[In English] Connie?

Elisa? What's going on?

- I need to talk to you. - About what?

You told me your husband works at the embassy.

Yeah.

I need you to speak with him and warn him.

About what?

Pablo Escobar is planning something with a communist group called the M-19.

I don't know what it is, but I know it's gonna be bad.

Wait, Pablo Escobar? How do you know anything about Escobar?

L... I just know. You need to warn him...

and you need to hide me.

OK. Come on.

Steve's already at work, but Javi lives downstairs.

I just hope he's here.

[Javier] I am.

- Well, what have we here? - I'll explain later.

I'll be right back. Go.

- [Connie] She told me that Escobar,,, - Slow down.

...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks they're gonna do something terrlble.

- Slow down. - Escobar is uslng members of M-19.

- Say that again? - Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

Escobarand M-19?

She dldn't tellme any details, just that It would be bad.

No... that doesn't make any sense.

She asked me to hide her, so I took her to Javl's apartment.

OK. All right.

[Sighs, clears throat]

- Agent Murphy! - All right.

Ambassador, I got information with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

- [reporter] ... supreme court building. - Oh, my God.

[Steve] ""Oh, my God''is right.

Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas stormed the Palace ofJustlce

and occupled the supreme court.

They took over 100 hostages and made a bunch of demands

about the redistribution of wealth and an end to injustice and tyranny...

but it was all bullshit.

The military attacked.

Dozens of lives were lost in the camage,

including half of Colombia's supreme court justices.

Most of the M-19 were k*ll.

Some escaped... but not before accompllshing theirtrue goal.

Settlng f*re to the room that contained 600,000 pages of evldence agalnst Escobar.

The entire case against him turned to ash.

In the Unlted States, the Mafla makes wltnesses disappear

so they can't testify in court.

In Colombia, Pablo Escobar made the whole court disappear.

[Reporter] The fires set by guerrillas earller in the day grew even stronger

as cannon shells exploded inside.

[Ioud knock at door]

[Pounding at door]

- Where is she? - Well, come on in.

You, up! Who in the f*ck is she and why is the military after her?

Put the g*n away.

Put it away.

She told me who she is. Put the g*n away.

- Can I say something? - No, you may not.

Murphy... calm down.

I have no idea why you'd get yourself involved in this.

Your wife brought herto me.

I appreciate you putting yourself out there for my wife, I truly do,

but why are we risking our whole careers overthis woman?

Because she can prove that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

If she can tie Escobarto the siege, I say we bring her in.

Well, she's M-19.

Noonan would have to turn her over to the Colombian military

and then she gets disappeared.

I'd like to avoid another Barry Seal situation.

So we're gonna harbor a communist fugitive?

Look, all she did was warn us.

She's not on anybody's radar.

She's not involved in anything.

The red X's you see in these pictures indicate M-19 revolutionaries

terminated by the Oolombian Special Forces.

The remaining individuals you see are fugitives.

Folks, this is more complicated than what it seems.

This was Escobar, classic. He's cut a deal with M-19.

Next you'll tell us Escobar sank the Titanic.

Was it coincidence the extradition evidence against him was destroyed?

He doesn't hold grudges, not if it suits his purposes.

- How do you know he cut a deal? - We have a confidential informant.

You willing to identify this informant, Agent Pena?

- No, I am not. - Needless to say...

Southern Command has rescinded its offer of resources to the DEA

in light of this communist aggression.

We need to target the M-19 leadership:

Ivan ""the Terrible"" Torres and Elisa Alvarez.

[Low murmurs in Spanish]

[In Spanish] They're looking for us everywhere.

What did you expect?

That it would be any different?

You did a very good job.

You can't imagine how much this is going to help our cause.

No, brother. The truth is, you helped mine.

You, Ivan...

gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

The same one that freed this country.

Now it belongs to you.

With it, you will continue the fight... to free this country.

I promise you, I will continue the fight.

You earned it, brother.

As for me...

I'II be in Panama until this blows over.

We are also...

Make sure you grab the briefcase.

And the f*cking sword.

I don't want to be good.<br/>

I am going to be great.<br/>
<br/>
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD<br/>
<br/>
A drug dealer running<br/>
for president. It was crazy, right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, not in Colombia.<br/>
Not in the mid-'80s.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Colombians go,<br/>
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.<br/>
<br/>
He was a f*cking winner.<br/>
<br/>
The living embodiment<br/>
of the Colombian dream.<br/>
<br/>
The guy who'd buy houses for the poor<br/>
in exchange for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors<br/>
to political success were there...<br/>
<br/>
and all he had to do was to get to them.<br/>
<br/>
And in order to do that,<br/>
<br/>
he asked Valeria Velez<br/>
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.<br/>
<br/>
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist<br/>
who represented the New Liberals,<br/>
<br/>
a party who claimed<br/>
to represent the people.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
I should've gotten into the taxi business.<br/>
<br/>
- Valeria, how are you doing?<br/>
- Well, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Duque.<br/>
<br/>
It gives me great pleasure to invite you<br/>
to the Hacienda Nápoles.<br/>
<br/>
- Nice to meet you.<br/>
- Please, come.<br/>
<br/>
After you, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I am not a rich person.<br/>
I am a poor person with money.<br/>
<br/>
And for that reason,<br/>
I think that...<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think that<br/>
I understand the people<br/>
<br/>
to whom the New Liberalism<br/>
wants to give a voice.<br/>
<br/>
The party clearly needs to hear<br/>
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great deal of talk<br/>
about how you have made your money.<br/>
<br/>
I need guarantees<br/>
concerning the origins of your fortune.<br/>
<br/>
And Valeria told you...<br/>
how much I am going to donate?<br/>
<br/>
- No, no--<br/>
- Look, I am not a politician.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a successful lawyer like you.<br/>
I come from the street... brother.<br/>
<br/>
I want to reassure you<br/>
that you will receive your piece.<br/>
<br/>
- It's not about that--<br/>
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,<br/>
<br/>
your piece would be what?<br/>
<br/>
$300,000 just for you.<br/>
<br/>
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee<br/>
for the Justice Minister or what?<br/>
<br/>
- Most definitely.<br/>
- All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go look at the hippos.<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Blackie.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
- And what about me?<br/>
- What about you?<br/>
<br/>
I don't get my piece?<br/>
<br/>
No, my queen.<br/>
The thing is that you...<br/>
<br/>
you're in this for love, right?<br/>
<br/>
Look, Minister...<br/>
<br/>
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.<br/>
<br/>
He has created sources of employment<br/>
throughout Medellín.<br/>
<br/>
The people love him,<br/>
and he loves the people.<br/>
<br/>
And from a legal point of view,<br/>
his money is clean.<br/>
<br/>
And according to Forbes Magazine,<br/>
he's a drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to believe all of that<br/>
American imperialist propaganda?<br/>
<br/>
Take a look.<br/>
<br/>
These are property holdings papers.<br/>
<br/>
Look.<br/>
<br/>
He's the owner of hundreds of properties<br/>
in Colombia and also the United States.<br/>
<br/>
In addition,<br/>
this man has no criminal record.<br/>
<br/>
If there was,<br/>
there would be proof of his background.<br/>
<br/>
How much is he paying you?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about our party, Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar is prepared<br/>
to contribute millions of dollars.<br/>
<br/>
We already support Jairo Ortega<br/>
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.<br/>
<br/>
Let's let Escobar be his alternate.<br/>
<br/>
What do you prefer...<br/>
rumors and insinuations,<br/>
<br/>
or fewer representatives in Congress?<br/>
<br/>
And just like that...<br/>
an honest man blinked.<br/>
<br/>
You're not going back to that comuna!<br/>
<br/>
What, you want me to stay<br/>
in this apartment for the next two years?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God, you do.<br/>
<br/>
Honey, your cat was k*ll<br/>
as a warning to me.<br/>
<br/>
Our cat.<br/>
<br/>
OK, our cat.<br/>
<br/>
What if you went back to Miami just for<br/>
a little while until things quiet down?<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?<br/>
- You're that good, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back<br/>
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.<br/>
<br/>
- You prepared to do that?<br/>
- I'm not giving in on this one!<br/>
<br/>
OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.<br/>
<br/>
I already stick out like a sore thumb.<br/>
<br/>
The bodyguards<br/>
are only gonna draw more attention.<br/>
<br/>
Just humor me.<br/>
<br/>
I can't do my job<br/>
if I'm worried about your safety.<br/>
<br/>
Mm...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, mind parking<br/>
down the street a little?<br/>
<br/>
I'll scream if I need you.<br/>
<br/>
- Buenos días, Father.<br/>
- Connie.<br/>
<br/>
What, are you surprised to see me?<br/>
<br/>
We've had American volunteers.<br/>
They come and go.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this one will keep coming.<br/>
<br/>
Surprised to see Elisa,<br/>
a communist M-19 guerrilla,<br/>
<br/>
working in the comuna?<br/>
<br/>
That's because you don't know<br/>
the liberation church in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And the priest... innocent, right?<br/>
<br/>
Wrong.<br/>
He's more of a commie than she is.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the gringa?<br/>
<br/>
A child of God, just like you.<br/>
<br/>
Hm. Got it.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see, you are here for a cat?<br/>
<br/>
This isn't just any cat.<br/>
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
- What's he saying?<br/>
- I'm telling him about the cat.<br/>
<br/>
And what you want<br/>
is for me to find a cat k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
It was the narcos, Suárez.<br/>
We don't take this shit lightly.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend is a little crazy.<br/>
<br/>
No hablo español.<br/>
I don't know what you're saying.<br/>
<br/>
I don't speak English.<br/>
<br/>
Get me some information, Suárez.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I don't have enough people<br/>
<br/>
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter<br/>
over a f*cking cat.<br/>
<br/>
If this was information about the narcos,<br/>
yes, my people are interested.<br/>
<br/>
But they won't give a f*ck about the cat.<br/>
<br/>
- What is he saying?<br/>
- They don't like cats in this country.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me about it.<br/>
<br/>
But if you want<br/>
to put all my people to work<br/>
<br/>
to find out who k*ll the f*cking cat,<br/>
that is going to cost you more.<br/>
<br/>
They broke into the house to k*ll his cat.<br/>
<br/>
I think they made him<br/>
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
Find out.<br/>
<br/>
- Is that a D-103?<br/>
- Yup.<br/>
<br/>
Let me get this straight.<br/>
Gotta pay this cop off for information,<br/>
<br/>
- then you gotta get a receipt?<br/>
- I gotta get reimbursed.<br/>
<br/>
This gentleman is an employee<br/>
of the American Embassy in our country,<br/>
<br/>
and he assures me that you gave out his<br/>
personal information to certain criminals.<br/>
<br/>
That's not true.<br/>
<br/>
These guys k*ll his cat.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you don't know this,<br/>
but the mistreatment of animals<br/>
<br/>
is a federal crime.<br/>
<br/>
Is this funny to you?<br/>
<br/>
They can bring formal charges against you,<br/>
and you could lose your job.<br/>
<br/>
Do you not need your job, Santiago?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I need it.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Murphy,<br/>
do you recognize these men?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you guys<br/>
stalled me at the airport<br/>
<br/>
so you could take my passport<br/>
and copy and scan it, didn't you?<br/>
<br/>
- What?<br/>
- May I?<br/>
<br/>
You both are being accused<br/>
of conspiring against a federal agent<br/>
<br/>
of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The cat is under the jurisdiction<br/>
of the American government.<br/>
<br/>
And to k*ll it is the same<br/>
as to k*ll a police dog.<br/>
<br/>
This is absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,<br/>
and I know exactly my--<br/>
<br/>
You will not disrespect them!<br/>
<br/>
Is that clear?<br/>
<br/>
If I open my mouth, they k*ll me...<br/>
and they k*ll my wife.<br/>
<br/>
He's having problems with his wife.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up!<br/>
<br/>
- Imbecile.<br/>
- OK, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
This is quite simple.<br/>
<br/>
I can get the phone number of the person<br/>
to whom you sent those documents,<br/>
<br/>
and I can tell him that you accused him<br/>
of being the cat k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
How does that sound?<br/>
<br/>
I sent a copy of that passport...<br/>
<br/>
to a man they call...<br/>
<br/>
""Poison.""<br/>
<br/>
OK, Poison.<br/>
<br/>
You're going to take this money<br/>
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
And this is the address.<br/>
<br/>
If they stop you on the road,<br/>
just salute the official,<br/>
<br/>
give them a little bribe<br/>
and continue forward.<br/>
<br/>
No v*olence.<br/>
<br/>
And you call me every two hours.<br/>
<br/>
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.<br/>
- OK, then. No showing off.<br/>
<br/>
No showing off!<br/>
<br/>
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.<br/>
- Got it.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Getting ready, right?<br/>
<br/>
You are meeting up with politicians,<br/>
not with gangsters.<br/>
<br/>
Aren't they the same thing, boss?<br/>
<br/>
Politicians scare easily.<br/>
<br/>
You're fine with just a p*stol.<br/>
<br/>
Go to it, then.<br/>
Go to it, dumbass.<br/>
<br/>
According to CNP wiretaps,<br/>
the sicario ""Poison""<br/>
<br/>
was recorded saying<br/>
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
For what purpose,<br/>
we don't know.<br/>
<br/>
But if we don't respond<br/>
to the obvious thr*at to Agent Murphy,<br/>
<br/>
we're sending the wrong message.<br/>
<br/>
Police have the information,<br/>
then they should make the arrest.<br/>
<br/>
No. No, if we leave it to them,<br/>
someone will sell us out.<br/>
<br/>
The narcos have informants<br/>
in their department.<br/>
<br/>
What Peña's driving at is that<br/>
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.<br/>
<br/>
- We can trust Carrillo.<br/>
- I don't have authority<br/>
<br/>
- over the Colombian police.<br/>
- All due respect, Ambassador,<br/>
<br/>
but you know where we are.<br/>
<br/>
With enough money,<br/>
you can get anything done.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me for saying so...<br/>
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?<br/>
<br/>
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo can be tipped off<br/>
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody in this country<br/>
keep a secret?<br/>
<br/>
I've got a spotter set up<br/>
about four kilometers away.<br/>
<br/>
He's gonna let us know<br/>
when Poison passes.<br/>
<br/>
You're gonna question them, right?<br/>
Because we need to--<br/>
<br/>
Poison's k*ll three of my men already.<br/>
<br/>
If I catch him alive,<br/>
you guys can question him here.<br/>
<br/>
Then you guys gotta go.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?<br/>
<br/>
Sixty-five.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, brother, that's a lot.<br/>
<br/>
You sure?<br/>
<br/>
I counted every single son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
All right!<br/>
<br/>
Sure, but are you counting<br/>
what happened last night?<br/>
<br/>
Of course,<br/>
that was number 65.<br/>
<br/>
Don't bullshit.<br/>
I was the one who sh*t that f*g.<br/>
<br/>
- Bullshit.<br/>
- Bullshit...<br/>
<br/>
if I was the one<br/>
who k*ll that little man.<br/>
<br/>
You only sh*t him<br/>
once he was already on the ground, d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
I sh*t him first.<br/>
<br/>
Come in.<br/>
<br/>
Did you give information about Poison<br/>
to the DEA?<br/>
<br/>
So?<br/>
<br/>
I'm still listening<br/>
to their phone conversations,<br/>
<br/>
and it's not a shipment of drugs.<br/>
<br/>
They're carrying<br/>
three million dollars to Bogotá,<br/>
<br/>
and if two guys from the DEA<br/>
stop that car,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.<br/>
<br/>
- You don't have 65, Poi.<br/>
- Yes, I do.<br/>
<br/>
Eh!<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!<br/>
<br/>
Look, 65, man!<br/>
<br/>
Now we're going<br/>
to have to wash the car, man!<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Pablo.<br/>
I have good news for you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to help you<br/>
avoid an enormous loss.<br/>
<br/>
And how much is it going to cost me?<br/>
<br/>
Ten percent... $300,000.<br/>
<br/>
- How did you find out?<br/>
- One of your men.<br/>
<br/>
That Poison... he talks too much.<br/>
<br/>
You should take his phone away.<br/>
<br/>
Five percent.<br/>
<br/>
Suspicious vehicle approaching.<br/>
<br/>
OK. We have visual<br/>
confirmation. Four kilometers away.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello?<br/>
- Poison?<br/>
<br/>
You bring your f*cking mouth<br/>
back here immediately!<br/>
<br/>
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.<br/>
- Now!<br/>
<br/>
The son of a bitch policeman<br/>
tapped my phone!<br/>
<br/>
- These f*g.<br/>
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo is really pissed off.<br/>
<br/>
Shut that mug,<br/>
or you will never reach 66, you hear?<br/>
<br/>
OK!<br/>
<br/>
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.<br/>
<br/>
- What the f*ck has happened here?<br/>
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.<br/>
<br/>
Either that or Suárez sold you out.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, if he did,<br/>
he must've had a better offer,<br/>
<br/>
and it wasn't a f*cking cat.<br/>
<br/>
He has been called the ""Paisa Robin Hood,""<br/>
<br/>
but he is much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
He is a man to whom the people<br/>
mean a great deal. All of us.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid suspicion<br/>
and questioning about his fortune,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo ran as an alternate<br/>
for Jairo Ortega,<br/>
<br/>
a former congressman from Antioquia.<br/>
<br/>
It was the first time an alternate was<br/>
more important than the main candidate.<br/>
<br/>
I am tired... of the<br/>
people with power running this country.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fight between the people<br/>
with power and poor people, weak people.<br/>
<br/>
And this fight must begin here!<br/>
<br/>
To have power does not mean<br/>
that one can abuse the poor.<br/>
<br/>
If I am elected...<br/>
<br/>
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...<br/>
<br/>
those who have never had a voice<br/>
will have a voice.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are hungry will have food.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to learn will have schools.<br/>
<br/>
And those who have dreams<br/>
<br/>
will see that there are no limits<br/>
to what you can achieve.<br/>
<br/>
In me, you have a friend<br/>
<br/>
whom you have always had,<br/>
<br/>
the friend of today, the friend<br/>
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!<br/>
- Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Jairo Ortega!<br/>
<br/>
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
- You were marvelous, my love.<br/>
- You sure?<br/>
<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
- Very good, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things we can improve,<br/>
but we'll work on them.<br/>
<br/>
OK, whatever you say.<br/>
<br/>
- Congratulations.<br/>
- Thank you so much, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations, ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
To vote for Jairo Ortega<br/>
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
Tata, what's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Why does that woman need to know<br/>
everything about each step you take?<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
- Valeria Velez.<br/>
- My love...<br/>
<br/>
Tata, she's a newspaper woman,<br/>
a reporter who follows the news.<br/>
<br/>
And right now, I'm the news.<br/>
<br/>
When you win, don't disrespect me<br/>
anymore with that bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
Come here, come here, come here.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly... come on.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
You are going to be the First Lady<br/>
of this country one of these days.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, you are going<br/>
to have to learn to deal with the press.<br/>
<br/>
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
She degrades you.<br/>
<br/>
Please, don't worry about Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
A car, please!<br/>
<br/>
A car to the hospital, now!<br/>
<br/>
You know what, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
To me, it looks like<br/>
you are handling things very badly.<br/>
<br/>
You need to start thinking more<br/>
about your family... and about business.<br/>
<br/>
Thing is,<br/>
you can't be a politician.<br/>
<br/>
Says who?<br/>
<br/>
You can't go strutting around<br/>
giving things to people<br/>
<br/>
simply so they will love you.<br/>
<br/>
We... are bandits.<br/>
<br/>
If you run for Congress, find someone else<br/>
to manage the laboratories.<br/>
<br/>
Señor Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Come meet your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
How beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Shh.<br/>
<br/>
Shh.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo is out of control.<br/>
<br/>
Mother Mary, man.<br/>
What do you want us to do?<br/>
<br/>
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking<br/>
as though he were some spoiled brat.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no?<br/>
<br/>
And why not?<br/>
<br/>
Careful with the thr*at<br/>
you cannot execute.<br/>
<br/>
You know what he's doing, right?<br/>
<br/>
According to Colombian law,<br/>
a congressman has total immunity.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think he's protecting himself<br/>
while we remain in the drift?<br/>
<br/>
I do. He thinks he's that f*cking<br/>
""Paisa Robin Hood.""<br/>
<br/>
So what do we do?<br/>
<br/>
Well... we fulfill our duties,<br/>
stuffing the ballot box,<br/>
<br/>
and later we let Pablo receive<br/>
the applause, and take the risk.<br/>
<br/>
We continue with our business...<br/>
in the shadows, like always.<br/>
<br/>
Carlos, what are the guys saying?<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that they're worried, right?<br/>
<br/>
They are not politically conscious,<br/>
brother.<br/>
<br/>
How can you expect them<br/>
to understand your objectives?<br/>
<br/>
You do understand me, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine... a state governed by us.<br/>
<br/>
Immunity for everyone, brother.<br/>
<br/>
We, Carlos, belong to the people.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to use your influence with the<br/>
others to convince them that I am right.<br/>
<br/>
If you win,<br/>
you don't need to explain anything.<br/>
<br/>
And if you lose...<br/>
there's nothing to explain.<br/>
<br/>
I like that.<br/>
<br/>
- h*tler said it.<br/>
- f*ck off.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
He also said that no politician<br/>
<br/>
should ever let his picture be taken<br/>
in a bathing suit.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's what he said.<br/>
<br/>
And if I tell you, Carlos...<br/>
<br/>
that what I want, sincerely...<br/>
<br/>
is to help the poor people<br/>
of this country...<br/>
<br/>
do you believe me or what?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies<br/>
<br/>
in the poorest neighborhoods<br/>
of his electoral district.<br/>
<br/>
He placed himself on the side<br/>
of the poor and the weak<br/>
<br/>
in the fight against the oligarchs,<br/>
""The Men of Always.""<br/>
<br/>
And just like any politician,<br/>
he made plenty of promises.<br/>
<br/>
Only difference was Pablo had the men<br/>
and the money to back them up.<br/>
<br/>
It was becoming clear to everyone<br/>
that Pablo was gonna win.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo! Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
The only question remaining was...<br/>
what to do about that.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo made good on his promise<br/>
to quit the labs,<br/>
<br/>
so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.<br/>
<br/>
With characteristic German efficiency,<br/>
he turned the labs into n*zi,<br/>
<br/>
and production rose 12 percent<br/>
in just two short months.<br/>
<br/>
Gacha and the Ochoas<br/>
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,<br/>
<br/>
debating how and when<br/>
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,<br/>
<br/>
his front man,<br/>
once the election was over.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the results<br/>
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.<br/>
<br/>
I say he's running toward his death.<br/>
<br/>
As for us, we were kind of divided.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot have Colombia<br/>
become a narco state.<br/>
<br/>
We need to find someone<br/>
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.<br/>
<br/>
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.<br/>
<br/>
No one will go on record.<br/>
<br/>
I got a better idea.<br/>
<br/>
We let him win.<br/>
<br/>
If we put him in the spotlight<br/>
and prove he's a tr*ffick,<br/>
<br/>
the embarrassment alone<br/>
might get this country off its ass.<br/>
<br/>
But first, we had to get proof<br/>
<br/>
that Pablo was the drug dealer<br/>
we knew he was.<br/>
<br/>
So we went to Suárez,<br/>
<br/>
and gave him a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
First, he told us that Pablo<br/>
was arrested for tr*ffick back in '76,<br/>
<br/>
and then he gave us the name<br/>
of a sergeant who could give us the files.<br/>
<br/>
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA<br/>
and the narcos' payroll.<br/>
<br/>
- Sixty-six.<br/>
- Bullshit. I sh*t him first.<br/>
<br/>
Then Suárez gave us<br/>
the name of the journalist<br/>
<br/>
who reported the arrest...<br/>
<br/>
...and then the lawyer<br/>
who defended Pablo...<br/>
<br/>
and finally, the judge<br/>
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.<br/>
<br/>
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.<br/>
<br/>
You get too close to us,<br/>
you disappear.<br/>
<br/>
We gotta get something<br/>
on this f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
If he was arrested,<br/>
there's gotta be a mug sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, the file's gone.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a mug sh*t,<br/>
then it's gone, too.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a photo,<br/>
there's a negative.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it dawned on us.<br/>
<br/>
We had to find someone<br/>
without Suárez's help,<br/>
<br/>
and that was the photographer<br/>
who had taken Pablo's mug sh*t years ago.<br/>
<br/>
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,<br/>
we put him into witness protection.<br/>
<br/>
- How long have you had this picture?<br/>
- That's classified.<br/>
<br/>
And what am I doing here?<br/>
<br/>
It's not America's role to get involved<br/>
in other countries' elections.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, the hand<br/>
of the United States remains invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Your party took money from Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I should think<br/>
you'd want to get ahead of this.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone took money.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it's all American money,<br/>
so why don't you take this to the press?<br/>
<br/>
It should come from you.<br/>
You're the Minister of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
Come election day,<br/>
sure enough, it was a landslide.<br/>
<br/>
The New Liberal party had the candidate<br/>
<br/>
who got the most votes<br/>
in all of Antioquia...<br/>
<br/>
and his name was Jairo Ortega.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>
<br/>
with clear use of my<br/>
mental and physical faculties...<br/>
<br/>
I wish to communicate to you my decision<br/>
<br/>
to resign from my seat<br/>
in the Congress of the Republic...<br/>
<br/>
...for reasons of family and health.<br/>
<br/>
But I am completely certain that<br/>
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria<br/>
<br/>
is going to continue<br/>
our social and political ideas,<br/>
<br/>
because Pablo is the voice of the people.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you very much.<br/>
- Thank you very much, Jairo.<br/>
<br/>
I will give my best effort.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you were born in a poor family,<br/>
<br/>
in a poor city, in a poor country,<br/>
<br/>
and by the time you were 28 years old,<br/>
<br/>
you have so much money<br/>
you can't even count it.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do?<br/>
<br/>
You make your dreams come true.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, nobody can control<br/>
the dreams they have.<br/>
<br/>
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
There's a reason magical realism<br/>
was born in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
It's a country where<br/>
dreams and reality are conflated...<br/>
<br/>
where, in their heads,<br/>
people fly as high as Icarus.<br/>
<br/>
But even magical realism has its limits.<br/>
<br/>
Congressman Escobar... Sir!<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to remind you<br/>
of the norms of etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot enter the hall<br/>
if you don't have a tie.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
- What is your name?<br/>
- Juan.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Juan...<br/>
<br/>
that is a really nice tie.<br/>
<br/>
- My girlfriend gave it to me.<br/>
- Really?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, she's in the history books now.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you very much, my son.<br/>
- Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
- All right.<br/>
<br/>
And when you get too close to the sun...<br/>
<br/>
your dreams may melt away.<br/>
<br/>
Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
This is to inform you that we have<br/>
a quorum and may now begin our session.<br/>
<br/>
The Minister of Justice,<br/>
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,<br/>
<br/>
is present here today<br/>
to address this honorable Congress.<br/>
<br/>
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Much has been made<br/>
of the issue of drug money,<br/>
<br/>
""hot money,""<br/>
in our national political process.<br/>
<br/>
I myself have been accused<br/>
of receiving campaign contributions<br/>
<br/>
from the narcotics tr*ffick<br/>
who have bought influence in these halls.<br/>
<br/>
To this charge, I plead guilty.<br/>
<br/>
In my eyes,<br/>
the sin of turning a blind eye<br/>
<br/>
is as great as the sin<br/>
of outright corruption.<br/>
<br/>
We are a nation of the blind,<br/>
and in our blindness,<br/>
<br/>
we have sold our country<br/>
to the highest bidder.<br/>
<br/>
It's time for us to open our eyes<br/>
and to see the light.<br/>
<br/>
Congressman Escobar...<br/>
<br/>
you stated that your great fortune<br/>
was built from a taxi company.<br/>
<br/>
This photograph<br/>
clearly contradicts your claim.<br/>
<br/>
For this reason,<br/>
I demand your resignation.<br/>
<br/>
You are not welcome in this chamber.<br/>
<br/>
You don't belong here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much, Juan.<br/>
Very kind.<br/>
<br/>
What interests the narcos<br/>
<br/>
isn't just the fall<br/>
of the Minister of Justice,<br/>
<br/>
but also to impede the strategy of<br/>
the government to combat his interests.<br/>
<br/>
His two arms: silver or lead.<br/>
<br/>
I want to inform the people<br/>
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours<br/>
<br/>
within which to present concrete proof<br/>
regarding the insinuations he made<br/>
<br/>
the day before yesterday<br/>
in the Hall of Representatives.<br/>
<br/>
To the contrary,<br/>
I will proceed to denounce him legally<br/>
<br/>
before the authorities<br/>
and before the Colombian justice system.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,<br/>
<br/>
trying to smear Lara with accusations.<br/>
<br/>
I am not looking<br/>
for, nor do I long for a confrontation<br/>
<br/>
before the Colombian people.<br/>
<br/>
I look for peace,<br/>
I have always preached peace,<br/>
<br/>
and have longed for peace and<br/>
the prosperity of the Colombian people.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to realize<br/>
that when members of Congress<br/>
<br/>
can be thr*at or bought at will,<br/>
<br/>
we see with clarity the real dimension<br/>
of the drug problem here in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
But Lara wouldn't back down.<br/>
<br/>
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,<br/>
<br/>
going after the guys<br/>
that we hadn't been able to touch.<br/>
<br/>
He revealed that six<br/>
of the country's nine soccer teams<br/>
<br/>
were owned by drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
Gacha the Mexican was forced<br/>
to give up ownership of his team,<br/>
<br/>
aptly nicknamed ""The Millionaires.""<br/>
<br/>
Lara denied flying permits<br/>
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.<br/>
<br/>
He even fined Pablo<br/>
for illegal importation<br/>
<br/>
of elephants and camels from Africa.<br/>
<br/>
And with the action of one brave man,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo knew his dream<br/>
of presidency was over.<br/>
<br/>
What are required are honest men,<br/>
<br/>
men who are able to put themselves<br/>
up against drug tr*ffick,<br/>
<br/>
who with complete tranquility buy or k*ll<br/>
any person or government institution<br/>
<br/>
who is against their interests.<br/>
<br/>
Rodrigo Lara became the most<br/>
important political figure in Colombia<br/>
<br/>
with his stand against the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
He just wouldn't stop going after them.<br/>
<br/>
His bravery in the face of danger made him<br/>
the most wanted man in the country.<br/>
<br/>
For his own safety, he was appointed<br/>
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.<br/>
<br/>
He was slated to leave in two weeks,<br/>
but a lot could happen in two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I think it might be a good idea<br/>
for you to wear this until you leave.<br/>
<br/>
You feel responsible, is that it?<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat, yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Are you so arrogant to think<br/>
you had any influence over my actions?<br/>
<br/>
That I put my life<br/>
and the life of my family at risk<br/>
<br/>
for American policy objectives?<br/>
<br/>
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,<br/>
outside of providing me with the picture,<br/>
<br/>
you... did nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The decision to speak out<br/>
was solely mine.<br/>
<br/>
And I highly advise you<br/>
to wear this vest, sir.<br/>
<br/>
I will accept this vest... out of respect<br/>
for your concern with my well-being.<br/>
<br/>
But I would advise you one thing<br/>
while you remain in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And what is that?<br/>
<br/>
We accept your help,<br/>
but never your condescension.<br/>
<br/>
When all this is over, Colombians<br/>
will be the heroes, and the victims.<br/>
<br/>
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.<br/>
<br/>
Just wear the vest.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Pablito.<br/>
<br/>
We knew they wouldn't<br/>
accept you in that circle.<br/>
<br/>
Damned bastards.<br/>
<br/>
You're too good for them, Pablito.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fight<br/>
that you cannot win, cousin.<br/>
<br/>
You need to think more<br/>
about your family and the business...<br/>
<br/>
and abandon that ridiculousness<br/>
once and for all.<br/>
<br/>
I will fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the vicious lies<br/>
and slander cast my way<br/>
<br/>
by Minister Lara and his cronies,<br/>
<br/>
I've decided to announce my resignation<br/>
from Congress of the Republic.<br/>
<br/>
I ran as a representative<br/>
for the common man,<br/>
<br/>
a voice for those who had no voice,<br/>
<br/>
but that has happened<br/>
through much of our history.<br/>
<br/>
The powerful have conspired to silence me.<br/>
<br/>
I dreamt of doing good.<br/>
<br/>
Those dreams are over.<br/>
<br/>
But make no mistake...<br/>
I will not go quietly.<br/>
<br/>
I will fight.<br/>
<br/>
""The Men of Always"" are mistaken<br/>
<br/>
if they think they can defeat<br/>
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't wear it.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't have made a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Our strategy had gotten a good man k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
It was the first time<br/>
I'd felt guilty about my job.<br/>
<br/>
- As for Suárez...<br/>
- Hey.<br/>
<br/>
...he made so much money<br/>
playing both sides,<br/>
<br/>
he decided to lift our spirits by giving<br/>
the DEA a token of his appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
I brought this for your friend's wife.<br/>
<br/>
- I hope she likes it.<br/>
- No, gracias.<br/>
<br/>
You're f*cking crazy, assh*le.</div>]","I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

'Course not.

Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

- ""Encounters""?
- Yeah.

I'm married.

Right.

Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife

are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

No, no, Carrillo's solid.

Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

Did you drop your wallet?

Passport.

How important is this cat to you?

Excuse me?

You gave someone your passport?

We were trying to get Puff
through Immigration.

""Puff""?

I didn't name it, dude.

tr*ffick pay people
at the airports for intel.

A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

f*cking price on my head?

There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

but you're safe... because of Kiki.

The ""Kiki"" Peña was referring to

was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

Kiki was captured and tortured.

They skinned his legs,
put a b*llet in each limb,

used an electric drill on his head
until he died.

What the f*ck were they thinking?

They could k*ll an American
government agent and get away with it?

Uncle Sam doesn't f*ck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world

got the message
that the DEA is off-limits.

Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

He died to save us all.

Do not tell Connie that story.

I won't.

- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?

This cat is DEA.

Mark my words, it will get justice.

My name is everywhere.

Newspapers...

magazines...

Everyone is talking about
the ""Paisa Robin Hood.""

Pablito, I'm sorry.
If I had known that--

You're going to have
to pay for that, my love.

Anything you want, Pablito.

Anything I want?

Yes, my love,
whatever you want.

You sure?

Uh-huh.

Then...

you're going to help me
get into Congress.

Yes, Pablo.

Yes.

Those shitty oligarchs.

Those people,
all of their lives...

don't know what it's like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

I come from nothing, Valeria...

and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

""I made my money from taxis"" isn't going
to work when you face the press.

Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

You need a proper political campaign.

I buy the press, my love.

And as far as a political party,

I am quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

I don't want to be good.

I am going to be great.

A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

A drug dealer running
for president. It was crazy, right?

Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

He was a f*cking winner.

The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.

The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.

As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

and all he had to do was to get to them.

And in order to do that,

he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,

a party who claimed
to represent the people.

Pablo!

I should've gotten into the taxi business.

- Valeria, how are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

Mr. Duque.

It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

- Nice to meet you.
- Please, come.

After you, Valeria.

Please.

Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

And for that reason,
I think that...

Well, I think that
I understand the people

to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

And Valeria told you...
how much I am going to donate?

- No, no--
- Look, I am not a politician.

I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.

I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

- It's not about that--
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

your piece would be what?

$300,000 just for you.

Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

- Most definitely.
- All right, then.

Let's go look at the hippos.
Come on.

Blackie.

Pablo?

- And what about me?
- What about you?

I don't get my piece?

No, my queen.
The thing is that you...

you're in this for love, right?

Look, Minister...

Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

The people love him,
and he loves the people.

And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug tr*ffick.

Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

Take a look.

These are property holdings papers.

Look.

He's the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

In addition,
this man has no criminal record.

If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

How much is he paying you?

I am thinking about our party, Minister.

Escobar is prepared
to contribute millions of dollars.

We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

Let's let Escobar be his alternate.

What do you prefer...
rumors and insinuations,

or fewer representatives in Congress?

And just like that...
an honest man blinked.

You're not going back to that comuna!

What, you want me to stay
in this apartment for the next two years?

Oh, my God, you do.

Honey, your cat was k*ll
as a warning to me.

Our cat.

OK, our cat.

What if you went back to Miami just for
a little while until things quiet down?

- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
- You're that good, huh?

I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.

- You prepared to do that?
- I'm not giving in on this one!

OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.

I already stick out like a sore thumb.

The bodyguards
are only gonna draw more attention.

Just humor me.

I can't do my job
if I'm worried about your safety.

Mm...

Hey, mind parking
down the street a little?

I'll scream if I need you.

- Buenos días, Father.
- Connie.

What, are you surprised to see me?

We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

Well, this one will keep coming.

Surprised to see Elisa,
a communist M-19 guerrilla,

working in the comuna?

That's because you don't know
the liberation church in Colombia.

And the priest... innocent, right?

Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.

Who is the gringa?

A child of God, just like you.

Hm. Got it.

Let's see, you are here for a cat?

This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

- What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

And what you want
is for me to find a cat k*ll.

It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

Your friend is a little crazy.

No hablo español.
I don't know what you're saying.

I don't speak English.

Get me some information, Suárez.

Look, I don't have enough people

to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a f*cking cat.

If this was information about the narcos,
yes, my people are interested.

But they won't give a f*ck about the cat.

- What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

Tell me about it.

But if you want
to put all my people to work

to find out who k*ll the f*cking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

They broke into the house to k*ll his cat.

I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

Find out.

- Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,

- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country,

and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

That's not true.

These guys k*ll his cat.

Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

is a federal crime.

Is this funny to you?

They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

Do you not need your job, Santiago?

Yes, I need it.

Mr. Murphy,
do you recognize these men?

Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?

- What?
- May I?

You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent

of the United States.

The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

And to k*ll it is the same
as to k*ll a police dog.

This is absurd.

Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my--

You will not disrespect them!

Is that clear?

If I open my mouth, they k*ll me...
and they k*ll my wife.

He's having problems with his wife.

Shut up!

- Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.

This is quite simple.

I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat k*ll.

How does that sound?

I sent a copy of that passport...

to a man they call...

""Poison.""

OK, Poison.

You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

And this is the address.

If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

No v*olence.

And you call me every two hours.

- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

No showing off!

- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- Got it.

What the f*ck are you doing?

Getting ready, right?

You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

Aren't they the same thing, boss?

Politicians scare easily.

You're fine with just a p*stol.

Go to it, then.
Go to it, dumbass.

According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario ""Poison""

was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

For what purpose,
we don't know.

But if we don't respond
to the obvious thr*at to Agent Murphy,

we're sending the wrong message.

Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.

No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.

The narcos have informants
in their department.

What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

but you know where we are.

With enough money,
you can get anything done.

Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.

Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to--

Poison's k*ll three of my men already.

If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

Then you guys gotta go.

Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?

Sixty-five.

Hey, brother, that's a lot.

You sure?

I counted every single son of a bitch.

All right!

Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

Of course,
that was number 65.

Don't bullshit.
I was the one who sh*t that f*g.

- Bullshit.
- Bullshit...

if I was the one
who k*ll that little man.

You only sh*t him
once he was already on the ground, d*ad.

I sh*t him first.

Come in.

Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

So?

I'm still listening
to their phone conversations,

and it's not a shipment of drugs.

They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá,

and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

Eh!

What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!

Look, 65, man!

Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

Son of a bitch.

Yes?

Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

And how much is it going to cost me?

Ten percent... $300,000.

- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

That Poison... he talks too much.

You should take his phone away.

Five percent.

Suspicious vehicle approaching.

OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

- Hello?
- Poison?

You bring your f*cking mouth
back here immediately!

- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

- These f*g.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.

Pablo is really pissed off.

Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?

OK!

I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

- What the f*ck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

Either that or Suárez sold you out.

Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

and it wasn't a f*cking cat.

He has been called the ""Paisa Robin Hood,""

but he is much more than that.

He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

a former congressman from Antioquia.

It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

And this fight must begin here!

To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

If I am elected...

if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

Those who are hungry will have food.

Those who want to learn will have schools.

And those who have dreams

will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

In me, you have a friend

whom you have always had,

the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

Thank you very much.

- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- Thank you very much.

My friend, Jairo Ortega!

Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

Thank you very much.

- You were marvelous, my love.
- You sure?

- Yes.
- Very good, Pablo.

There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

OK, whatever you say.

- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

Congratulations, ma'am.

Excuse me.

To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

Tata, what's wrong?

Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

What are you talking about?

- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.

And right now, I'm the news.

When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

Slowly... come on.

Come on.

You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

She degrades you.

Please, don't worry about Valeria.

Pablo!

A car, please!

A car to the hospital, now!

You know what, Pablo?

To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

Says who?

You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

simply so they will love you.

We... are bandits.

If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

Señor Escobar?

Come meet your daughter.

God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

How beautiful.

Shh.

Shh.

Pablo is out of control.

Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

Oh, no?

And why not?

Careful with the thr*at
you cannot execute.

You know what he's doing, right?

According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

I do. He thinks he's that f*cking
""Paisa Robin Hood.""

So what do we do?

Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

Carlos, what are the guys saying?

I imagine that they're worried, right?

They are not politically conscious,
brother.

How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

You do understand me, brother.

Imagine... a state governed by us.

Immunity for everyone, brother.

We, Carlos, belong to the people.

I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

I like that.

- h*tler said it.
- f*ck off.

Yes.

He also said that no politician

should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.

Well, that's what he said.

And if I tell you, Carlos...

that what I want, sincerely...

is to help the poor people
of this country...

do you believe me or what?

Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

in the fight against the oligarchs,
""The Men of Always.""

And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

Pablo! Pablo!

The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.

With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into n*zi,

and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

his front man,
once the election was over.

As soon as the results
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.

I say he's running toward his death.

As for us, we were kind of divided.

We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

No one will go on record.

I got a better idea.

We let him win.

If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a tr*ffick,

the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

But first, we had to get proof

that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

So we went to Suárez,

and gave him a lot of money.

First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for tr*ffick back in '76,

and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I sh*t him first.

Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

who reported the arrest...

...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

You get too close to us,
you disappear.

We gotta get something
on this f*ck.

If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug sh*t.

Yeah, well, the file's gone.

If there was a mug sh*t,
then it's gone, too.

If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

Finally, it dawned on us.

We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,

and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug sh*t years ago.

We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

And what am I doing here?

It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

Your party took money from Escobar.

I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

Everyone took money.

By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

The New Liberal party had the candidate

who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

and his name was Jairo Ortega.

Ladies and gentlemen,

with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

I wish to communicate to you my decision

to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

...for reasons of family and health.

But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

because Pablo is the voice of the people.

- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.

I will give my best effort.

Thank you very much.

Imagine you were born in a poor family,

in a poor city, in a poor country,

and by the time you were 28 years old,

you have so much money
you can't even count it.

What do you do?

You make your dreams come true.

Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

But even magical realism has its limits.

Congressman Escobar... Sir!

Excuse me.

Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

All right.

- What is your name?
- Juan.

Look, Juan...

that is a really nice tie.

- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

Yes.

Well, she's in the history books now.

- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

- Thank you.
- All right.

And when you get too close to the sun...

your dreams may melt away.

Good morning.

This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

The Minister of Justice,
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

Thank you very much.

Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

""hot money,""
in our national political process.

I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

from the narcotics tr*ffick
who have bought influence in these halls.

To this charge, I plead guilty.

In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

Congressman Escobar...

you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

You are not welcome in this chamber.

You don't belong here.

Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

What interests the narcos

isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice,

but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

His two arms: silver or lead.

I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

trying to smear Lara with accusations.

I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

before the Colombian people.

I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

can be thr*at or bought at will,

we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

But Lara wouldn't back down.

He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

were owned by drug tr*ffick.

Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

aptly nicknamed ""The Millionaires.""

Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

of elephants and camels from Africa.

And with the action of one brave man,

Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

What are required are honest men,

men who are able to put themselves
up against drug tr*ffick,

who with complete tranquility buy or k*ll
any person or government institution

who is against their interests.

Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

with his stand against the narcos.

He just wouldn't stop going after them.

His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

You feel responsible, is that it?

Somewhat, yes, sir.

Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

for American policy objectives?

Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

you... did nothing.

The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

And what is that?

We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

Just wear the vest.

Oh, Pablito.

We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

Damned bastards.

You're too good for them, Pablito.

This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

You need to think more
about your family and the business...

and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

I will fix it.

Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

by Minister Lara and his cronies,

I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

I ran as a representative
for the common man,

a voice for those who had no voice,

but that has happened
through much of our history.

The powerful have conspired to silence me.

I dreamt of doing good.

Those dreams are over.

But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

I will fight.

""The Men of Always"" are mistaken

if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

He didn't wear it.

Wouldn't have made a difference.

Our strategy had gotten a good man k*ll.

It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

- As for Suárez...
- Hey.

...he made so much money
playing both sides,

he decided to lift our spirits by giving
the DEA a token of his appreciation.

I brought this for your friend's wife.

- I hope she likes it.
- No, gracias.

You're f*cking crazy, assh*le."
01x02 - The Sword of Simón Bolivar,"[<div class=""content"">By the time I left Miami,<br/>
<br/>
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons<br/>
of cocaine every year.<br/>
<br/>
To satisfy American noses,<br/>
the narcos ramped up their operations.<br/>
<br/>
- Here, honey.<br/>
- Ah, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?<br/>
- Hm?<br/>
<br/>
Oh... Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
That's beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
They were flying so many planes,<br/>
<br/>
they needed a refueling stop<br/>
between Colombia and Miami.<br/>
<br/>
So Carlos Lehder<br/>
bought an island in the Bahamas<br/>
<br/>
as a transshipment point<br/>
for the drugs and money.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out...<br/>
it was a damn good place to party.<br/>
<br/>
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,<br/>
with the three things Carlos liked most:<br/>
<br/>
- sex, drugs, and n*zi sympathizers.<br/>
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!<br/>
<br/>
Let's get down!<br/>
<br/>
The problem was no longer<br/>
demand... it was supply.<br/>
<br/>
We should be over the Amazon by now.<br/>
<br/>
From 10,000 feet, Colombia<br/>
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.<br/>
<br/>
But things were different<br/>
on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo and his partners built superlabs<br/>
the size of small cities.<br/>
<br/>
From leaf to paste to powder,<br/>
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.<br/>
<br/>
At 50 grand a kilo,<br/>
that's five billion dollars a year.<br/>
<br/>
These guys weren't f*ck' around.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in<br/>
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
They added it to liquor, to coffee,<br/>
and just to be funny...<br/>
<br/>
they put it back in Coca-Cola.<br/>
<br/>
¿Patrón?<br/>
<br/>
Looks good?<br/>
<br/>
Cocaine was no longer<br/>
hidden alongside products.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to sell better<br/>
than the original.<br/>
<br/>
It was the product.<br/>
<br/>
It's time to take Pablo's money.<br/>
<br/>
The narcos even had their<br/>
own drug-sniffing dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Gacha bet Pablo that not even<br/>
a German scientist could fool his dog.<br/>
<br/>
- Search.<br/>
<br/>
- What's happening? Look at that.<br/>
<br/>
Your prize dog didn't even stop.<br/>
<br/>
There's no coke in that boat.<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
It's blended<br/>
right into the fiberglass hull.<br/>
<br/>
Give me the money...<br/>
the cash!<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you got taken<br/>
with this dog, brother.<br/>
<br/>
- Hold this a moment.<br/>
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...<br/>
<br/>
It's OK, it's OK.<br/>
<br/>
- Are you f*cking crazy?<br/>
- What?<br/>
<br/>
It's my dog.<br/>
<br/>
Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
You want to know what happened? Go look.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo, we have a f*ck problem.<br/>
- Bastard m*rder.<br/>
<br/>
- He k*ll the dog.<br/>
- I don't give a shit.<br/>
<br/>
If we don't resolve this problem,<br/>
we're all d*ad. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
- Come on, man.<br/>
- Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see...<br/>
<br/>
- This is the problem?<br/>
<br/>
People are watching us, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
They're asking themselves<br/>
how two small businessmen<br/>
<br/>
- suddenly came up with so much cash.<br/>
- Gustavo, brother...<br/>
<br/>
just launder the money.<br/>
<br/>
Make it look legitimate...<br/>
that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't that what Al Capone did?<br/>
<br/>
- Al Capone?<br/>
- Al Capone.<br/>
<br/>
You're a dumbass, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
- Al Capone is a terrible example.<br/>
- Why?<br/>
<br/>
Because Al Capone<br/>
never had this much cash.<br/>
<br/>
This is too much to launder.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then...<br/>
<br/>
let's buy a bigger washing machine.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what they tried first.<br/>
<br/>
On paper, Pablo had<br/>
the most profitable taxi company ever.<br/>
<br/>
He only had three cars,<br/>
<br/>
but he was pulling in<br/>
more than five million dollars a week.<br/>
<br/>
And Gacha had the most successful<br/>
emerald mine of all time.<br/>
<br/>
He would inject bad stones with oil<br/>
to make them shiny,<br/>
<br/>
then have his friends in Miami<br/>
buy the emeralds with drug money<br/>
<br/>
and give them as gifts<br/>
to hookers in town.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody was happy.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter what they did,<br/>
they couldn't hide all that money.<br/>
<br/>
It just kept coming in.<br/>
<br/>
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,<br/>
<br/>
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...<br/>
<br/>
I told you we have to fly low.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep spending like that,<br/>
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
And if that happens,<br/>
the government is going to have our asses.<br/>
<br/>
Enough, Gustavo, enough.<br/>
<br/>
What do you want me to say?<br/>
<br/>
Bury it.<br/>
<br/>
- How's that?<br/>
- Bury the cash.<br/>
<br/>
And cut the bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Go on, p*ssy.<br/>
<br/>
- And that's what they did.<br/>
<br/>
They buried it in fields...<br/>
<br/>
they hid it in caletas,<br/>
hiding places in walls and ceilings.<br/>
<br/>
They even stuck a million dollars<br/>
in Pablo's mother's couch.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Mom.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm praying, Pablo.<br/>
- Just for a second.<br/>
<br/>
Sit.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.<br/>
<br/>
I'll buy you another sofa later.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be better<br/>
if you put all this money in a bank, son?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
All bankers are bandits.<br/>
<br/>
Really, honey?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo called this accountant ""Blackbeard,""<br/>
<br/>
not because he looked like a pirate,<br/>
<br/>
but because his job was to map out<br/>
where the treasure was hidden.<br/>
<br/>
But not even the pirate did the trick.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was Colombia itself.<br/>
<br/>
It was too small a country<br/>
for a fortune that big.<br/>
<br/>
It was inevitable... someone, somewhere<br/>
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Forbes Magazine says...<br/>
<br/>
that the narcos have more money<br/>
<br/>
than the richest capitalist pig<br/>
in this country.<br/>
<br/>
- Let me see?<br/>
<br/>
If we kidnap someone in their family,<br/>
what are they going to do?<br/>
<br/>
- Call the police?<br/>
<br/>
Commander.<br/>
<br/>
It says here that Gacha, ""The Mexican,""<br/>
is the ninth richest man in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I say we kidnap his son.<br/>
<br/>
- He's a psycho maniac, comrade.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, he's bought off half the military.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the Ochoa brothers<br/>
are number 14 on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Their sister Marta<br/>
goes to the university.<br/>
<br/>
How about her?<br/>
<br/>
I like that more.<br/>
The Ochoas are soft.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a second.<br/>
<br/>
What about Pablo Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
I know what you're thinking.<br/>
<br/>
No one's crazy enough<br/>
to kidnap drug dealers, right?<br/>
<br/>
But if you're thinking that, it's because<br/>
you're not familiar with M-19.<br/>
<br/>
- M-19 was a communist guerrilla group<br/>
<br/>
made up of college students<br/>
and intellectuals<br/>
<br/>
who read too much Karl Marx<br/>
for their own good.<br/>
<br/>
Their leader was<br/>
Ivan ""the Terrible"" Torres...<br/>
<br/>
a history professor<br/>
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,<br/>
<br/>
but understood the power of symbols.<br/>
<br/>
He broke into<br/>
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum<br/>
<br/>
with his buddy Alejandro<br/>
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,<br/>
<br/>
and stole a national treasure...<br/>
the sword of Simón Bolívar,<br/>
<br/>
the mythic general who led Colombia<br/>
to independence from the Spanish empire.<br/>
<br/>
These jokers even left a note:<br/>
<br/>
""Bolívar, your sword<br/>
returns to the battlefield.""<br/>
<br/>
It was a stroke of genius...<br/>
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.<br/>
<br/>
And it made them famous overnight.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess it went to their heads.<br/>
<br/>
What about Pablo Escobar?<br/>
He's the richest of them all.<br/>
<br/>
Escobar gives money to the poor.<br/>
<br/>
You're right.<br/>
Escobar is a man of the people.<br/>
<br/>
He's all right with me.<br/>
<br/>
OK, then.<br/>
<br/>
- Let's do the Ochoas.<br/>
<br/>
March 13th, 1981,<br/>
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,<br/>
<br/>
was also the day the Lion<br/>
completed 100 trips to Miami.<br/>
<br/>
- Hola.<br/>
<br/>
Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.<br/>
- Sí.<br/>
<br/>
Does the cat have any papers?<br/>
<br/>
- Sí.<br/>
- Please.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me a second, please.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form<br/>
<br/>
and no I-435<br/>
identifying papers, either.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir. They brought an<br/>
American cat with them.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't<br/>
officially state that it is indeed a cat.<br/>
<br/>
I also can't guarantee<br/>
that it's American.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, I'm not trying<br/>
to make your life more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
OK, sir.<br/>
<br/>
My boss is not having a good day.<br/>
<br/>
I think his wife left him.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,<br/>
so... how important is this cat to you?<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me?<br/>
<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
Come with me, please.<br/>
<br/>
So... wait here, please.<br/>
<br/>
And my boss will ask you<br/>
for this paper later.<br/>
<br/>
How long is it gonna be?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo! Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
While I was trying to get into Bogotá,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was trying to get into politics.<br/>
<br/>
When he said he was going<br/>
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.<br/>
<br/>
- Hello, Pablo.<br/>
- Hello, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
- This is my wife, Tata.<br/>
- Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry.<br/>
Everything will be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just not used<br/>
to these type of things.<br/>
<br/>
Just be yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am, it would be best<br/>
if you weren't here.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Tata,<br/>
there are a lot of people here.<br/>
<br/>
It might not be good for the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the house.<br/>
<br/>
Where is this guy?<br/>
We've been waiting for hours now.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he's at ""terapia de pareja.""<br/>
<br/>
What's that?<br/>
<br/>
Couples counseling.<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
What're you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the<br/>
man known as ""the Robin Hood of the poor""<br/>
<br/>
for his generosity<br/>
with the poor of Medellín.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you heard that right.<br/>
<br/>
She just compared Pablo Escobar<br/>
to f*cking Robin Hood.<br/>
<br/>
- And in a way, she was right.<br/>
<br/>
When you've run out of ways<br/>
to hide your money,<br/>
<br/>
that's when you give it to the poor.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us about your program,<br/>
""Medellín Without Slums,"" Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Rionegro,<br/>
not too far from here.<br/>
<br/>
And I asked myself how a government<br/>
that exists for the people<br/>
<br/>
can be so out of touch<br/>
with what they need.<br/>
<br/>
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,<br/>
<br/>
plus the construction<br/>
of 400 houses in this community.<br/>
<br/>
I hear you told your mother that one day<br/>
you would be president of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any political aspirations,<br/>
Mr. Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
None at all.<br/>
My business takes up most of my time.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.<br/>
<br/>
For decades, our country has been led by<br/>
Lopez and other families that are wealthy<br/>
<br/>
who made their fortune<br/>
off exploiting the poor.<br/>
<br/>
They don't know what<br/>
common people dream of, but I do...<br/>
<br/>
- Connie, you know who that is?<br/>
<br/>
Bet he could get our cat<br/>
into the country.<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe it.<br/>
<br/>
They don't even know<br/>
he's a f*cking drug dealer.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you very much.<br/>
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
At the time, Pablo was<br/>
just a blip on my radar.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know<br/>
I was about to be a blip on his.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we've been waiting<br/>
for hours. Thanks for coming out.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,<br/>
so here is the cat's vaccination--<br/>
<br/>
Your passport.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry?<br/>
<br/>
Your passport, please.<br/>
<br/>
- Gracias.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do at<br/>
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?<br/>
<br/>
I am in, uh,<br/>
janitorial services.<br/>
<br/>
Janitorial services.<br/>
<br/>
Another one.<br/>
<br/>
Your embassy must be very clean.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah.<br/>
You bet your ass it is.<br/>
<br/>
Your cat's cleared.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And just like that, the narcos<br/>
had me on file the very first day.<br/>
<br/>
As for Valeria Velez,<br/>
<br/>
the journalist who first<br/>
interviewed Pablo... watch out.<br/>
<br/>
She was as dangerous as M-19.<br/>
<br/>
Does your wife do it standing up?<br/>
<br/>
- Aah!<br/>
<br/>
Don't ever disrespect Tata.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Pablo...<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
It won't happen again.<br/>
<br/>
I promise.<br/>
<br/>
How can I apologize? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?<br/>
<br/>
You gotta give it to her.<br/>
<br/>
- She saw Pablo coming a mile away.<br/>
<br/>
And she got herself in just the<br/>
right place to take full advantage of him.<br/>
<br/>
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,<br/>
<br/>
who figured the best way<br/>
to get inside narco information<br/>
<br/>
was to hang out<br/>
with the same women they did.<br/>
<br/>
We get better every time we practice.<br/>
<br/>
You're amazing, Javier.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
don't go overboard.<br/>
<br/>
It's the truth.<br/>
<br/>
What can you offer me to drink?<br/>
<br/>
Whiskey or tap water.<br/>
<br/>
Water.<br/>
<br/>
What you're missing<br/>
in this apartment is a woman.<br/>
<br/>
It's fine the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I wasn't offering.<br/>
<br/>
Here.<br/>
<br/>
If you were a client,<br/>
you would have paid me already.<br/>
<br/>
- And you wouldn't know my real name.<br/>
- Don't take it the wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
It's cash from Uncle Sam<br/>
for the information you never gave me.<br/>
<br/>
Take it.<br/>
<br/>
And my visa?<br/>
<br/>
Give me something I can use<br/>
and we'll talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
- I'm going to Medellín.<br/>
- Work or play?<br/>
<br/>
I have to take care of my child.<br/>
<br/>
I can pay, too.<br/>
<br/>
Those guys are richer<br/>
than Uncle Sam, Javi.<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
- What?<br/>
- Give me a kiss.<br/>
<br/>
Give me a kiss.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll have to find another girl.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with that.<br/>
We're all going to Medellín.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us are even going by plane.<br/>
<br/>
Helena?<br/>
<br/>
Helena.<br/>
<br/>
Whose party is it?<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, God! What was that?<br/>
<br/>
That was like a .38.<br/>
<br/>
- About four blocks away.<br/>
- Oh...<br/>
<br/>
- Welcome to Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
- Should we do it under the bed?<br/>
<br/>
Just one thing...<br/>
Who told you about this?<br/>
<br/>
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo says they're not going to<br/>
pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo, too.<br/>
<br/>
- And Jorge?<br/>
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.<br/>
<br/>
- Then what?<br/>
- They're all going to a meeting.<br/>
<br/>
At Las Margaritas.<br/>
<br/>
- Everyone?<br/>
- Yeah, they'll all be there.<br/>
<br/>
First day at the American Embassy.<br/>
<br/>
- I met my partner...<br/>
- Javier?<br/>
<br/>
...who introduced me to the DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.<br/>
<br/>
These guys are R.I.P.<br/>
""Retired in Place.""<br/>
<br/>
- Eat me, Peña.<br/>
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.<br/>
<br/>
We'll telex the T-3 reports.<br/>
They go straight to Washington.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to Medellín?<br/>
<br/>
- Then the Mil Group.<br/>
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy, this is Mil Group.<br/>
<br/>
They advise Colombian military<br/>
on communist thr*at in the countryside.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, those are classified.<br/>
<br/>
- Now they're declassified.<br/>
- That's the ambassador's call.<br/>
<br/>
No problem.<br/>
<br/>
And the last stop...<br/>
the ambassador's office.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need this intel?<br/>
<br/>
There's an unusual number of prost*tute<br/>
headed to Medellín this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.<br/>
<br/>
First class airfare,<br/>
five-star hotels.<br/>
<br/>
The narcos are having a meeting<br/>
and then a party.<br/>
<br/>
What does the M-19<br/>
have to do with this?<br/>
<br/>
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.<br/>
Intel suggests it was M-19.<br/>
<br/>
I need access to the M-19 files<br/>
to confirm.<br/>
<br/>
If I find out one single dollar<br/>
of American taxpayer money<br/>
<br/>
went to any of those hookers,<br/>
it'll be your ass.<br/>
<br/>
OK, thank you.<br/>
One last thing, Ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Agent Peña?<br/>
<br/>
I'm filing a visa request<br/>
for my informant. I need your signature.<br/>
<br/>
You're bothering me.<br/>
<br/>
She sure likes you.<br/>
<br/>
Is your informant really a prost*tute?<br/>
<br/>
Everybody works for somebody.<br/>
<br/>
The very next day,<br/>
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's home turf.<br/>
<br/>
First stop: Carlos Holguín School,<br/>
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.<br/>
<br/>
- Good day, Major.<br/>
- Good day.<br/>
<br/>
Your intel was good. The traquetos<br/>
are gathering at Las Margaritas.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to meet our new DEA,<br/>
Steve Murphy.<br/>
<br/>
Fresh meat.<br/>

<br/>
Then we went straight to a fancy<br/>
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.<br/>
<br/>
The pictures I took that day<br/>
helped to ID guys for months to come.<br/>
<br/>
- There was Carlos Lehder...<br/>
<br/>
- ...the Ochoa brothers...<br/>
<br/>
Fernando Galeano,<br/>
""the Wolfman""...<br/>
<br/>
Is that Gacha?<br/>
<br/>
I've never seen him<br/>
with other tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
And last but not least...<br/>
Gustavo and Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Get pictures of that f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
They were all under one roof<br/>
and Peña got us there to document it all.<br/>
<br/>
What we didn't know was<br/>
that we were witnessing the formation<br/>
<br/>
of the famed Medellín cartel.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo took advantage<br/>
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa<br/>
<br/>
to bring all the narcos together<br/>
for the very first time.<br/>
<br/>
And then he proclaimed himself<br/>
their leader.<br/>
<br/>
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,<br/>
<br/>
is that we form an organization.<br/>
<br/>
Pool our resources to train soldiers,<br/>
trade knowledge and buy information.<br/>
<br/>
And so the message is clear,<br/>
we're going to name our group<br/>
<br/>
""Death to Kidnappers.""<br/>
<br/>
What I propose:<br/>
<br/>
I will manage all operational aspects.<br/>
<br/>
All you need to do<br/>
is cover my expenses.<br/>
<br/>
What you gentlemen will receive in return:<br/>
two things.<br/>
<br/>
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.<br/>
<br/>
Two... and at this moment,<br/>
the most important...<br/>
<br/>
I promise to return<br/>
Marta Ochoa to her family.<br/>
<br/>
- Salud.<br/>
<br/>
Death to Kidnappers!<br/>
<br/>
We knew the meeting was over<br/>
when the hookers came to play.<br/>
<br/>
Peña had finally<br/>
gotten one of his informants<br/>
<br/>
right into the heart of the action.<br/>
<br/>
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget La Quica!<br/>
Take care of him, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, my love.<br/>
<br/>
- How are you?<br/>
- Good. And you?<br/>
<br/>
I like your hat.<br/>
<br/>
It looks good on you.<br/>
<br/>
- Do you think so?<br/>
- Yes, it looks good.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
- Very cute.<br/>
<br/>
She should be here by now.<br/>
<br/>
You think she slipped?<br/>
<br/>
Nah, she's no dummy.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Aah...<br/>
<br/>
Helena wanted a US visa so bad,<br/>
<br/>
she was willing to do anything<br/>
to help our cause.<br/>
<br/>
And that was a problem.<br/>
<br/>
- You're tired.<br/>
- Hm?<br/>
<br/>
Let me relax you a bit.<br/>
<br/>
So what happened at that meeting<br/>
that made you so tired?<br/>
<br/>
What did you hear?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
Just making conversation.<br/>
<br/>
They're telling me the girl<br/>
left a long time ago.<br/>
<br/>
- She's already d*ad.<br/>
- No, they wouldn't k*ll her at the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Then they k*ll her somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
She knew the risks.<br/>
<br/>
If we're going back,<br/>
we go back now.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to find the girl.<br/>
<br/>
I can pick up a sicario.<br/>
You OK with that?<br/>
<br/>
- I'm going with you.<br/>
- What about Fresh Meat?<br/>
<br/>
Gonna stick around here<br/>
and see if she shows up, OK?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah, and where are you going?<br/>
- We're gonna go look for her.<br/>
<br/>
That's it, guys.<br/>
<br/>
- Guys.<br/>
- Hey, what happened?<br/>
<br/>
That little girl doesn't move.<br/>
Like a d*ad cow.<br/>
<br/>
What, did you k*ll her?<br/>
<br/>
It's my turn now.<br/>
<br/>
- Where's the girl?<br/>
<br/>
- Where's the girl, assh*le?<br/>
- I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Choke him.<br/>
<br/>
- Enough with the party.<br/>
<br/>
I gotta rough this girl up.<br/>
<br/>
Gacha wants to know<br/>
if she knows something.<br/>
<br/>
Gacha's paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a second...<br/>
I don't like them bruised.<br/>
<br/>
Let me have a little more fun,<br/>
then I'll let her go.<br/>
<br/>
- It's all right, boys.<br/>
<br/>
This one's for all of you!<br/>
<br/>
- Slap her around!<br/>
<br/>
Any news on the radio?<br/>
<br/>
- Should I tell him?<br/>
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I don't speak English.<br/>
<br/>
- How far is it?<br/>
- Come on, you piece of shit.<br/>
<br/>
Helena?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to get you out<br/>
of here, OK? I promise.<br/>
<br/>
All right. She's coming out.<br/>
<br/>
Copy, Major.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, boys.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, gringo.<br/>
Carrillo is calling. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
- No habla inglés, huh?<br/>
<br/>
¡Vamos!<br/>
<br/>
Where the f*ck's Peña?<br/>
¿Dónde está Peña?<br/>
<br/>
Over there.<br/>
<br/>
- How is she?<br/>
- Sedated.<br/>
<br/>
- Is she gonna be OK?<br/>
- Physically, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Mentally, I haven't got a f*cking clue.<br/>
<br/>
- You left me behind on purpose.<br/>
- Look, man--<br/>
<br/>
If we're gonna be partners,<br/>
I don't get left behind.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,<br/>
to sit on the f*cking sidelines.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever's going on here...<br/>
I'm in all the way.<br/>
<br/>
Is that understood?<br/>
<br/>
Understood.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you know what that means.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's message to<br/>
the kidnappers was simple.<br/>
<br/>
He was going to k*ll them, one by one,<br/>
until he got Marta Ochoa back.<br/>
<br/>
Ivan ""the Terrible"" thought he could<br/>
hide in the jungle and wait it out.<br/>
<br/>
Sooner or later,<br/>
he figured the narcos would cave in.<br/>
<br/>
Big mistake.<br/>
<br/>
M-19 didn't stand a chance.<br/>
<br/>
""Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound...<br/>
or your family is next.""<br/>
<br/>
Signed, ""Death to Kidnappers.""<br/>
<br/>
Please! Please, let me go.<br/>
<br/>
- Hurry up!<br/>
- Please, don't!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say,<br/>
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
And the k*ll didn't stop.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo had tasted blood,<br/>
and he liked it.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him to get a little closer.<br/>
<br/>
A little closer. A little closer!<br/>
<br/>
You know what, boss?<br/>
Go a little higher.<br/>
<br/>
A little bit higher<br/>
and a little bit closer<br/>
<br/>
so you can see the tree!<br/>
<br/>
That's it.<br/>
<br/>
Now a little bit higher<br/>
so you can see the little tree!<br/>
<br/>
That...<br/>
<br/>
That's it. Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS<br/>
<br/>
A little more.<br/>
<br/>
That's it! There you go.<br/>
<br/>
- Much better.<br/>
- Yes, boss.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't I tell you<br/>
not to let anyone into the park?<br/>
<br/>
- I'll take care of it.<br/>
- Are you crazy or what?<br/>
<br/>
Stupid assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
It's a woman with a baby.<br/>
<br/>
Take a picture<br/>
so we can send it to the newspapers.<br/>
<br/>
Do it.<br/>
<br/>
Good day, ma'am.<br/>
<br/>
- Good day.<br/>
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean the park is closed?<br/>
<br/>
May I escort you out?<br/>
<br/>
Why is it closed?<br/>
I come by here every day.<br/>
<br/>
It's because there is a foul odor<br/>
and I don't want the child to get sick.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I smelled something.<br/>
<br/>
- Right?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, look,<br/>
what a beautiful little baby.<br/>
<br/>
Right, just like his dad.<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
- You must be proud.<br/>
- Yes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I<br/>
are having a baby very soon.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, very good.<br/>
Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,<br/>
but as long as it's healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.<br/>
The most important thing is health.<br/>
<br/>
Sending the photos of the<br/>
hanging M-19 to the newspapers<br/>
<br/>
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.<br/>
<br/>
If he could do this<br/>
to the feared communists,<br/>
<br/>
he could do it to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Ivan ""the Terrible""<br/>
was quick to realize...<br/>
<br/>
there was only one thing he could do.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Don Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
What do you want us to do<br/>
with this guy?<br/>
<br/>
Should I k*ll him or what?<br/>
<br/>
From what I can see,<br/>
you're not going to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Here I am,<br/>
so you can finish what you started...<br/>
<br/>
but with the sword of Bolívar.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very beautiful gift.<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
Stand up.<br/>
<br/>
I guarantee no harm<br/>
will come to you or your family.<br/>
<br/>
From now on,<br/>
we are going to work together.<br/>
<br/>
Go in peace, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what I think it is?<br/>
<br/>
You've gotta be kidding.<br/>
<br/>
I want you<br/>
to run my day-to-day operations.<br/>
<br/>
And you'll do what?<br/>
<br/>
Liberate Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.<br/>
<br/>
The narcos had their army,<br/>
but me and Peña had ours, too.<br/>
<br/>
Many Colombians<br/>
like Major Horacio Carrillo<br/>
<br/>
were so invested<br/>
in the future of their country<br/>
<br/>
that they were ready<br/>
to do whatever it took to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
This was a w*r that would shake<br/>
an entire country to its foundations.<br/>
<br/>
And in the carnage...<br/>
mine would be shaken as well.<br/>
<br/>
Even my wife, Connie,<br/>
wanted to help.<br/>
<br/>
She got a job as a nurse<br/>
in a local comuna.<br/>
<br/>
- She wanted to make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Look, our escolta will drive me<br/>
there and back every day.<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- He'll wait outside all day.<br/>
<br/>
You know the last time you were in church<br/>
is when we got married.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm letting the Lord<br/>
back into my life.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, stop right here.<br/>
<br/>
Praise God.<br/>
<br/>
Perdón.<br/>
<br/>
I want that escolta watching<br/>
every inch of you at that comuna now.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, did we leave the door open?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God, Steve!<br/>
<br/>
- Get back.<br/>
<br/>
You stay right there<br/>
and don't move.</div>]","By the time I left Miami,

Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.

To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.

- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.

- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

Oh... Yeah.

That's beautiful.

They were flying so many planes,

they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:

- sex, drugs, and n*zi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Let's get down!

The problem was no longer
demand... it was supply.

We should be over the Amazon by now.

From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

But things were different
on the ground.

Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.

At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.

These guys weren't f*ck' around.

Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...

they put it back in Coca-Cola.

¿Patrón?

Looks good?

Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

This is going to sell better
than the original.

It was the product.

It's time to take Pablo's money.

The narcos even had their
own drug-sniffing dogs.

Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.

- Search.

- What's happening? Look at that.

Your prize dog didn't even stop.

There's no coke in that boat.

Come here.

It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

Give me the money...
the cash!

Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

It's OK, it's OK.

- Are you f*cking crazy?
- What?

It's my dog.

Son of a bitch.

What happened?

You want to know what happened? Go look.

Pablo?

- Pablo, we have a f*ck problem.
- Bastard m*rder.

- He k*ll the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

If we don't resolve this problem,
we're all d*ad. Come on.

- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.

Let's see...

- This is the problem?

People are watching us, Pablo.

They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo, brother...

just launder the money.

Make it look legitimate...
that's all.

Isn't that what Al Capone did?

- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

You're a dumbass, Pablo.

- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

This is too much to launder.

Well, then...

let's buy a bigger washing machine.

And that's what they tried first.

On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.

He only had three cars,

but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.

And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.

He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,

then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money

and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

Everybody was happy.

But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.

It just kept coming in.

You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,

houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...

I told you we have to fly low.

If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

Enough, Gustavo, enough.

What do you want me to say?

Bury it.

- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

And cut the bullshit.

Go on, p*ssy.

- And that's what they did.

They buried it in fields...

they hid it in caletas,
hiding places in walls and ceilings.

They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.

Hey, Mom.

- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.

Sit.

It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.

I'll buy you another sofa later.

Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

No.

All bankers are bandits.

Really, honey?

Pablo called this accountant ""Blackbeard,""

not because he looked like a pirate,

but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

But not even the pirate did the trick.

The problem was Colombia itself.

It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.

It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.

Forbes Magazine says...

that the narcos have more money

than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

- Let me see?

If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

- Call the police?

Commander.

It says here that Gacha, ""The Mexican,""
is the ninth richest man in the world.

I say we kidnap his son.

- He's a psycho maniac, comrade.

Plus, he's bought off half the military.

Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

Their sister Marta
goes to the university.

How about her?

I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.

Wait a second.

What about Pablo Escobar?

I know what you're thinking.

No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?

But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.

- M-19 was a communist guerrilla group

made up of college students
and intellectuals

who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.

Their leader was
Ivan ""the Terrible"" Torres...

a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,

but understood the power of symbols.

He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum

with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,

and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar,

the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.

These jokers even left a note:

""Bolívar, your sword
returns to the battlefield.""

It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.

And it made them famous overnight.

And I guess it went to their heads.

What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

Escobar gives money to the poor.

You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

He's all right with me.

OK, then.

- Let's do the Ochoas.

March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,

was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.

- Hola.

Good afternoon.

- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
- Sí.

Does the cat have any papers?

- Sí.
- Please.

Thank you.

Mm.

Excuse me a second, please.

Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form

and no I-435
identifying papers, either.

Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

Yes, sir. They brought an
American cat with them.

Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

OK, sir.

My boss is not having a good day.

I think his wife left him.

Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?

Excuse me?

OK.

Come with me, please.

So... wait here, please.

And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

How long is it gonna be?

I don't know.

- Pablo! Pablo!

While I was trying to get into Bogotá,

Pablo was trying to get into politics.

When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.

Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

I'm just not used
to these type of things.

Just be yourself.

Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

It might not be good for the baby.

Go to the house.

Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

Maybe he's at ""terapia de pareja.""

What's that?

Couples counseling.

Right.

What're you doing?

Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.

Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as ""the Robin Hood of the poor""

for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.

Yeah, you heard that right.

She just compared Pablo Escobar
to f*cking Robin Hood.

- And in a way, she was right.

When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

that's when you give it to the poor.

But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

Tell us about your program,
""Medellín Without Slums,"" Mr. Escobar.

I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

can be so out of touch
with what they need.

Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...

- Connie, you know who that is?

Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

I can't believe it.

They don't even know
he's a f*cking drug dealer.

- Thank you very much.
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

At the time, Pablo was
just a blip on my radar.

I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination--

Your passport.

I'm sorry?

Your passport, please.

- Gracias.

What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?

I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

Janitorial services.

Another one.

Your embassy must be very clean.

Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

Your cat's cleared.

Enjoy Colombia.

And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.

As for Valeria Velez,

the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

She was as dangerous as M-19.

Does your wife do it standing up?

- Aah!

Don't ever disrespect Tata.

- Do you hear me?

I'm sorry, Pablo...
I'm sorry.

Forgive me.

It won't happen again.

I promise.

How can I apologize? Huh?

Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

You gotta give it to her.

- She saw Pablo coming a mile away.

And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,

who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

was to hang out
with the same women they did.

We get better every time we practice.

You're amazing, Javier.

Well...

don't go overboard.

It's the truth.

What can you offer me to drink?

Whiskey or tap water.

Water.

What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

It's fine the way it is.

Well, I wasn't offering.

Here.

If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

Take it.

And my visa?

Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

What are you doing this weekend?

- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?

I have to take care of my child.

I can pay, too.

Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

Come here.

- What?
- Give me a kiss.

Give me a kiss.

I guess I'll have to find another girl.

Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

Some of us are even going by plane.

Helena?

Helena.

Whose party is it?

- Oh, God! What was that?

That was like a .38.

- About four blocks away.
- Oh...

- Welcome to Bogotá.

- Should we do it under the bed?

Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

Pablo says they're not going to
pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.

Gustavo, too.

- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.

- Then what?
- They're all going to a meeting.

At Las Margaritas.

- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.

First day at the American Embassy.

- I met my partner...
- Javier?

...who introduced me to the DEA.

Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

These guys are R.I.P.
""Retired in Place.""

- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

We are going to Medellín?

- Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

Murphy, this is Mil Group.

They advise Colombian military
on communist thr*at in the countryside.

Hey, those are classified.

- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

No problem.

And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.

Why do you need this intel?

There's an unusual number of prost*tute
headed to Medellín this weekend.

Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

What does the M-19
have to do with this?

Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.

Yes, Agent Peña?

I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

You're bothering me.

She sure likes you.

Is your informant really a prost*tute?

Everybody works for somebody.

The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,

Pablo's home turf.

First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

- Good day, Major.
- Good day.

Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

I want you to meet our new DEA,
Steve Murphy.

Fresh meat.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

- There was Carlos Lehder...

- ...the Ochoa brothers...

Fernando Galeano,
""the Wolfman""...

Is that Gacha?

I've never seen him
with other tr*ffick.

And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

Get pictures of that f*ck.

They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.

What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

of the famed Medellín cartel.

Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa

to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,

is that we form an organization.

Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

""Death to Kidnappers.""

What I propose:

I will manage all operational aspects.

All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.

One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

- Salud.

Death to Kidnappers!

We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

right into the heart of the action.

Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

Sit down, my love.

- How are you?
- Good. And you?

I like your hat.

It looks good on you.

- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

Let's see.

- Very cute.

She should be here by now.

You think she slipped?

Nah, she's no dummy.

Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

Yeah.

Aah...

Helena wanted a US visa so bad,

she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

And that was a problem.

- You're tired.
- Hm?

Let me relax you a bit.

So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

What did you hear?

Nothing.
Just making conversation.

They're telling me the girl
left a long time ago.

- She's already d*ad.
- No, they wouldn't k*ll her at the hotel.

Then they k*ll her somewhere else.

She knew the risks.

If we're going back,
we go back now.

I want you to find the girl.

I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

That's it, guys.

- Guys.
- Hey, what happened?

That little girl doesn't move.
Like a d*ad cow.

What, did you k*ll her?

It's my turn now.

- Where's the girl?

- Where's the girl, assh*le?
- I don't know.

I don't know.

Choke him.

- Enough with the party.

I gotta rough this girl up.

Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

Gacha's paranoid.

Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.

- It's all right, boys.

This one's for all of you!

- Slap her around!

Any news on the radio?

- Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

Sorry, I don't speak English.

- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

Helena?

I'm going to get you out
of here, OK? I promise.

All right. She's coming out.

Copy, Major.

Let's go, boys.

Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

- No habla inglés, huh?

¡Vamos!

Where the f*ck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?

Over there.

- How is she?
- Sedated.

- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.

Mentally, I haven't got a f*cking clue.

- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man--

If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the f*cking sidelines.

Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

Is that understood?

Understood.

I hope you know what that means.

Pablo's message to
the kidnappers was simple.

He was going to k*ll them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.

Ivan ""the Terrible"" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.

Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.

Big mistake.

M-19 didn't stand a chance.

""Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound...
or your family is next.""

Signed, ""Death to Kidnappers.""

Please! Please, let me go.

- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.

And the k*ll didn't stop.

Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.

Tell him to get a little closer.

A little closer. A little closer!

You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

A little bit higher
and a little bit closer

so you can see the tree!

That's it.

Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

That...

That's it. Perfect.

DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

A little more.

That's it! There you go.

- Much better.
- Yes, boss.

Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

Stupid assh*le.

It's a woman with a baby.

Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

Do it.

Good day, ma'am.

- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

What do you mean the park is closed?

May I escort you out?

Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

I thought I smelled something.

- Right?
- Yes.

Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.

My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.

Oh, very good.
Congratulations!

I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.

Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

Sending the photos of the
hanging M-19 to the newspapers

gave Pablo an image of invincibility.

If he could do this
to the feared communists,

he could do it to anyone.

Ivan ""the Terrible""
was quick to realize...

there was only one thing he could do.

Hey, Don Pablo.

What do you want us to do
with this guy?

Should I k*ll him or what?

From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.

Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...

but with the sword of Bolívar.

It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

Stand up.

I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

From now on,
we are going to work together.

Go in peace, brother.

Is that what I think it is?

You've gotta be kidding.

I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

And you'll do what?

Liberate Colombia.

Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.

Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo

were so invested
in the future of their country

that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.

This was a w*r that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.

And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.

She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

- She wanted to make a difference.

I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

Look, our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

Hey, stop right here.

Praise God.

Perdón.

I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

Hey, did we leave the door open?

Oh, my God, Steve!

- Get back.

You stay right there
and don't move."
01x01 - Descenso,"[<div class=""content"">Nowadays, the US<br/>
government can listen to anything you say.<br/>
<br/>
They know where you are,<br/>
they know who you're talking to,<br/>
<br/>
and trust me,<br/>
they know who you're f*cking.<br/>
<br/>
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,<br/>
and you're doomed.<br/>
<br/>
But in Colombia in 1989,<br/>
it wasn't that easy.<br/>
<br/>
First off,<br/>
there was no Internet.<br/>
<br/>
No cells.<br/>
<br/>
The best they had were satellite phones,<br/>
<br/>
and in order to capture a satellite phone,<br/>
you had to fly directly over it.<br/>
<br/>
On top of that, the only people<br/>
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...<br/>
<br/>
the landowners, the politicians...<br/>
<br/>
And lucky for us,<br/>
the narcos were richer than them all.<br/>
<br/>
What's up, Lizard?<br/>
<br/>
We're going out tonight.<br/>
<br/>
And once you got a signal,<br/>
you didn't know who you were listening to.<br/>
<br/>
That's why back then, the US government<br/>
developed software that could identify<br/>
<br/>
the voices of our targets.<br/>
<br/>
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,<br/>
gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
No GPS either.<br/>
<br/>
Hammer, prepare to engage.<br/>
<br/>
Once we got a target,<br/>
we still had to locate it.<br/>
<br/>
So we had to triangulate their signals<br/>
using assets on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
OK, he's in Modelia.<br/>
He's on the west side.<br/>
<br/>
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?<br/>
<br/>
Can you be more specific?<br/>
Police units are standing by.<br/>
<br/>
La Dispensaria.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a table ready.<br/>
<br/>
Show up around midnight.<br/>
<br/>
- It's gonna be raining women.<br/>
- Poison didn't know it,<br/>
<br/>
but he'd just made himself a date.<br/>
<br/>
Negative on Hammer. This f*ck<br/>
just told us where he's going.<br/>
<br/>
Hammer, disengage.<br/>
<br/>
So who do we give this to? DEA?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Pe?a.<br/>
- Pe?a's an assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.<br/>
- Sure.<br/>
<br/>
By ""the other guy,"" he meant me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Steve Murphy,<br/>
Drug Enforcement Agent.<br/>
<br/>
And as you can see,<br/>
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Poison will be partying<br/>
at La Dispensaria.<br/>
<br/>
Got it.<br/>
<br/>
He's meeting Lizard<br/>
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.<br/>
<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
I would've loved<br/>
to go after Poison myself,<br/>
<br/>
but the DEA is restricted<br/>
in a foreign country.<br/>
<br/>
So I did just what you would do...<br/>
I called the cops.<br/>
<br/>
Hola.<br/>
<br/>
La Dispensaria?<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Guess who that was.<br/>
<br/>
Your partner.<br/>
<br/>
He just gave me a great gift.<br/>
<br/>
Poison.<br/>
<br/>
Does he know<br/>
how I'm going to package it?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, sure.<br/>
<br/>
He's not a fool.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go.<br/>
<br/>
Gonna stick me with the bill?<br/>
<br/>
Cheap son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
In case you're wondering,<br/>
this is the assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
Javier Pe?a, my partner.<br/>
<br/>
And this is Colonel Carrillo,<br/>
the leader of the Search Bloc,<br/>
<br/>
the unit we helped create<br/>
to capture the bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, did he have<br/>
a lot of love for the narcos.<br/>
<br/>
Party time in Zona Rosa.<br/>
Everybody goes there.<br/>
<br/>
Especially the local hitmen.<br/>
<br/>
Colombians call them sicarios.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up, son?<br/>
- Hey, brother.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go inside and have a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.<br/>
<br/>
Crazy f*ck<br/>
who k*ll dozens of people.<br/>
<br/>
Probably hundreds.<br/>
<br/>
But don't get me wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I would've sent Carrillo there<br/>
even if Poison never k*ll a fly.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a lot of love<br/>
for the narcos either.<br/>
<br/>
It's on, boys!<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna stop on 14th<br/>
and go around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
Riano, Trujillo,<br/>
you're in the front with me.<br/>
<br/>
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.<br/>
- Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
You got it, boys? We're gonna<br/>
go at it with everything we got.<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna k*ll these f*ck,<br/>
all right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't blame you if you<br/>
held me responsible for this bloodbath.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.<br/>
<br/>
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.<br/>
<br/>
My fellow Americans...<br/>
<br/>
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
People forget,<br/>
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.<br/>
<br/>
We thought he was one of the good guys.<br/>
<br/>
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet<br/>
was a good guy<br/>
<br/>
because he hated the commies.<br/>
<br/>
So we helped Pinochet seize power.<br/>
<br/>
Then Pinochet turned around<br/>
and k*ll thousands of people.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not such a good guy after all.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes,<br/>
bad guys do good things.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody knows this, but back in '73,<br/>
Chile was on its way<br/>
<br/>
to being the world's biggest<br/>
cocaine processing and exporting center.<br/>
<br/>
How many times do<br/>
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?<br/>
<br/>
They had deserts to hide the labs<br/>
and miles of unpatrolled coastline<br/>
<br/>
to ship the product north.<br/>
<br/>
To be productive,<br/>
you can't waste money! Come on!<br/>
<br/>
You're surrounded!<br/>
<br/>
- Hands up!<br/>
- Everybody on your knees!<br/>
<br/>
But Pinochet spoiled the party.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck is going on here?<br/>
<br/>
On the ground!<br/>
<br/>
He shut down 33 labs<br/>
and arrested 346 drug dealers.<br/>
<br/>
And then, being Pinochet...<br/>
<br/>
he had them all k*ll.<br/>
<br/>
Attention!<br/>
<br/>
w*apon ready!<br/>
<br/>
Aim!<br/>
<br/>
Ready amm*nit*on!<br/>
<br/>
f*re!<br/>
<br/>
They say when<br/>
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,<br/>
<br/>
only the cockroaches will survive.<br/>
<br/>
I guess they were right.<br/>
<br/>
The b*ll*ts missed Mateo Moreno,<br/>
aka Cockroach,<br/>
<br/>
and he was smart enough to play d*ad.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn't k*ll on that day.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, he won the damn lottery.<br/>
<br/>
Cockroach had been<br/>
stealing from his bosses for months.<br/>
<br/>
Now he was left alone in the world<br/>
with the perfect product.<br/>
<br/>
A product whose offer<br/>
creates its own demand.<br/>
<br/>
Start packing.<br/>
We have to leave the country.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking Pinochet<br/>
is k*ll the whole world.<br/>
<br/>
- But you're not a communist.<br/>
- No, not a communist, something worse.<br/>
<br/>
A drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
- A drug tr*ffick?<br/>
- Yes, a drug tr*ffick.<br/>
<br/>
Back then, we were just<br/>
finding out about the effects of cocaine<br/>
<br/>
on the human brain.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't know much, but we knew<br/>
it was some pretty powerful shit.<br/>
<br/>
This will give us better results, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Cocaine hijacks<br/>
the pleasure centers in the brain.<br/>
<br/>
A rat will choose cocaine<br/>
over food and water.<br/>
<br/>
It would choose cocaine over sleep,<br/>
over sex... over life itself.<br/>
<br/>
The human brain<br/>
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...<br/>
<br/>
unless we're talking about cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
Cockroach knew<br/>
he had the perfect product.<br/>
<br/>
He just needed to smuggle it<br/>
to the right markets.<br/>
<br/>
Gracias.<br/>
<br/>
And the best smugglers in the world<br/>
were in Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA<br/>
<br/>
Like Goldilocks,<br/>
he had three options.<br/>
<br/>
And pay attention, because all three<br/>
are important to this story.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.<br/>
<br/>
A typical Colombian smuggling family.<br/>
<br/>
- They were smart and rich...<br/>
- Salud!<br/>
<br/>
But Cockroach felt the high life<br/>
had made 'em too soft.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible partner<br/>
was Jos? Rodr?guez Gacha,<br/>
<br/>
nicknamed ""The Mexican,""<br/>
for his love of tequila and sombreros.<br/>
<br/>
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.<br/>
<br/>
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,<br/>
even by Colombian standards.<br/>
<br/>
If you make it to the top...<br/>
<br/>
it means you've k*ll your enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, your partners.<br/>
<br/>
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade<br/>
had made Gacha too hard.<br/>
<br/>
A man Cockroach knew would be just right.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
The man who would<br/>
change my life forever.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was making a k*ll<br/>
in the smuggling business.<br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,<br/>
you name it.<br/>
<br/>
At the time,<br/>
Pablo owned half the police in Medell?n.<br/>
<br/>
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.<br/>
<br/>
They didn't play by the same rules.<br/>
<br/>
Good day.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar?<br/>
<br/>
Where's Felipo?<br/>
<br/>
Felipo's been arrested.<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.<br/>
<br/>
He used to work for you. Now he's going<br/>
to jail. What do you think about that?<br/>
<br/>
- Do you know who you're talking to?<br/>
- Shut the f*ck up.<br/>
<br/>
- I wasn't talking to you.<br/>
- Relax, Gustavo, please.<br/>
<br/>
Show some respect.<br/>
<br/>
Now what's the problem,<br/>
Mr. Jose Luis?<br/>
<br/>
How do you know my name?<br/>
<br/>
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.<br/>
<br/>
And that's Nacho Ibarra.<br/>
<br/>
There's Garcia, Lopez...<br/>
<br/>
- Is that Pinilla?<br/>
- Yes, Pinilla.<br/>
<br/>
- That's Pinilla.<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Pinilla...<br/>
<br/>
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a rat's ass.<br/>
Open the f*cking trucks.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have all day.<br/>
<br/>
Open it.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
Who the f*ck do you think you are?<br/>
<br/>
You don't even bother<br/>
to hide your contraband.<br/>
<br/>
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah? You don't say.<br/>
<br/>
Where are your import papers?<br/>
<br/>
You need papers for these TV sets.<br/>
<br/>
Take them.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not<br/>
Medell?n police making a shit salary.<br/>
<br/>
- Look, brother, it's not for you.<br/>
- Then who?<br/>
<br/>
It's for Carlitos.<br/>
<br/>
Your son.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Pinilla!<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter just<br/>
got her driver's license, right?<br/>
<br/>
I've got some car stereo systems in there<br/>
that are really cool. Real nice.<br/>
<br/>
That friend of yours, Lopez...<br/>
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
- Right? She's a fox.<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.<br/>
<br/>
What's she doing with a guy like you?<br/>
<br/>
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?<br/>
<br/>
Why don't I have my boys<br/>
drop off a few gifts?<br/>
<br/>
Colonel, how is your mom doing?<br/>
<br/>
- She just got out of the hospital, right?<br/>
- Yes, she's feeling better.<br/>
<br/>
- Good. That makes us happy, right?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen...<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to tell you who I am.<br/>
<br/>
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.<br/>
<br/>
My eyes are everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
That means you guys<br/>
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia<br/>
<br/>
without me knowing about it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you understand? Not a finger.<br/>
<br/>
One day, I'm going to be<br/>
President of the Republic of Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
So look, I make deals for a living.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you can stay calm<br/>
and accept my deal...<br/>
<br/>
or accept the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Silver...<br/>
<br/>
or lead.<br/>
<br/>
You decide.<br/>
<br/>
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.<br/>
- All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
Yo, Pablo!<br/>
<br/>
- This is Pablo.<br/>
- Hello.<br/>
<br/>
- Nice to meet you.<br/>
- Mateo Moreno.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
""Cockroach"" to my friends.<br/>
<br/>
All right,<br/>
yesterday we were talking,<br/>
<br/>
and I think this business<br/>
can make us a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
Explain.<br/>
<br/>
Well... I get the paste in Peru.<br/>
<br/>
I will handle<br/>
the chemical part of production,<br/>
<br/>
and all the other details<br/>
in producing this exquisite white powder.<br/>
<br/>
What I need from you<br/>
is to help me get it into Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
Now tell him how much it costs.<br/>
<br/>
In Chile, this little thing<br/>
costs ten bucks a gram.<br/>
<br/>
- They sell it by grams?<br/>
- Yes, it's very good. Look...<br/>
<br/>
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,<br/>
you want to do some more.<br/>
<br/>
Also...<br/>
<br/>
it's a digestive aid.<br/>
It makes you want to take a shit.<br/>
<br/>
It's very clean, this stuff.<br/>
Want some?<br/>
<br/>
If this is really that good<br/>
and we can make some money,<br/>
<br/>
we can find room on our trucks.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell it in Bogot?, Barranquilla,<br/>
Cali, Cartagena...<br/>
<br/>
We're going to be rich.<br/>
<br/>
- What did you say your name was?<br/>
- Cockroach.<br/>
<br/>
Well look, Cuca...<br/>
<br/>
you don't have any vision,<br/>
my friend.<br/>
<br/>
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...<br/>
<br/>
imagine how much<br/>
it will sell for in Miami.<br/>
<br/>
I love that song.<br/>
<br/>
Rodrigo! One more.<br/>
<br/>
Back then, Miami was a paradise.<br/>
<br/>
I signed up for the sand,<br/>
surf and women.<br/>
<br/>
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing<br/>
wore flip-flops.<br/>
<br/>
DEA! Stop!<br/>
<br/>
I was a young DEA agent,<br/>
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.<br/>
<br/>
Kevin was a little slow afoot.<br/>
<br/>
Why you running, huh?<br/>
<br/>
What you got? What is this? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
What is that?<br/>
<br/>
That right there...<br/>
that's a g*dd*mn promotion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go celebrate.<br/>
<br/>
- Whoo!<br/>
- Look at that.<br/>
<br/>
Go! Go! Go!<br/>
<br/>
How you like me now?<br/>
<br/>
How much money you owe me?<br/>
<br/>
What happened to the money<br/>
you owed me last week?<br/>
<br/>
That's right, that's right.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
All right, who do we pick?<br/>
<br/>
How 'bout her?<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no,<br/>
we gotta f*ck with him.<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.<br/>
- Um...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, right there.<br/>
See her? At the bar?<br/>
<br/>
- Which one?<br/>
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.<br/>
<br/>
- Oh! Strike!<br/>
- She's hot.<br/>
<br/>
- All right.<br/>
- Whoo!<br/>
<br/>
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, while you were walking back,<br/>
she was checking your ass out.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, she was checking out your ass.<br/>
<br/>
Get the f*ck outta here.<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, she eye-f*cked you<br/>
the entire time you were bowling.<br/>
<br/>
She was. She was eye-f*cking you.<br/>
The entire time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.<br/>
<br/>
- Uh-huh. That's his type.<br/>
- Talking about the blond one?<br/>
<br/>
No, the other one.<br/>
Of course the blond one.<br/>
<br/>
She's the hottest one there.<br/>
She's your type.<br/>
<br/>
You dicking me around?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck it, I'm going in.<br/>
<br/>
- Go get her.<br/>
- Mm!<br/>
<br/>
- Yup.<br/>
- Hey, while you're up there,<br/>
<br/>
get us another pitcher, will ya?<br/>
<br/>
- Pace yourself.<br/>
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.<br/>
<br/>
How you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Busy.<br/>
<br/>
I just said, ""Look, if you don't<br/>
wanna be there, you don't have to be.""<br/>
<br/>
No one's forcing you to do anything.""<br/>
So, I don't know...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, those bastards got me.<br/>
<br/>
But I couldn't let it end like that.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
See those guys over there?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, they're f*cking with me.<br/>
<br/>
Telling me you were checking out my ass,<br/>
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?<br/>
<br/>
You're a cop?<br/>
<br/>
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.<br/>
<br/>
Drug Enforcement?<br/>
<br/>
So you're the one<br/>
making pot more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?<br/>
<br/>
I wanna show these guys up.<br/>
Why don't you, uh...<br/>
<br/>
give me your phone number?<br/>
<br/>
How about a fake number?<br/>
<br/>
That'll work.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?<br/>
<br/>
- I'm sorry for the trouble.<br/>
- Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good night.<br/>
<br/>
Aah...<br/>
<br/>
sh*t down!<br/>
<br/>
- Where's the pitcher at?<br/>
- The pitcher? Oh, I...<br/>
<br/>
I didn't make it back<br/>
with the pitcher.<br/>
<br/>
I just came up with this and<br/>
I couldn't read it. What does that say?<br/>
<br/>
- Read it and weep!<br/>
- Aw... Gimme that.<br/>
<br/>
How much did that cost you?<br/>
<br/>
- That's your handwriting.<br/>
- It's not my handwriting!<br/>
<br/>
I figured, what the hell.<br/>
<br/>
Worst that could happen,<br/>
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
So it wasn't a fake.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you might figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
After all, you're DEA.<br/>
<br/>
And just like that... she had me.<br/>
<br/>
The minute Pablo laid his eyes<br/>
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,<br/>
<br/>
cocaine had him.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a while.<br/>
<br/>
These are my friends,<br/>
Pablo and Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Would you like a little coffee?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, a coffee?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, a coffee.<br/>
<br/>
- How about you, Pablo?<br/>
- No.<br/>
<br/>
You sure?<br/>
<br/>
My factory is small,<br/>
but highly productive.<br/>
<br/>
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to<br/>
use children because of their tiny feet.<br/>
<br/>
Little magic leaves.<br/>
<br/>
The kerosene<br/>
separates the drug from the leaf.<br/>
<br/>
Over here, the sulfuric acid<br/>
distills and distills it.<br/>
<br/>
Then you cut it,<br/>
and mix it with gasoline.<br/>
<br/>
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise<br/>
out of the liquid.<br/>
<br/>
Let it dry, dry, dry.<br/>
<br/>
You use ammonia to get the paste.<br/>
<br/>
And here it is.<br/>
It's pasty... but pure.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the prize.<br/>
<br/>
It's like the kitchen in your house.<br/>
<br/>
Like baking a cake.<br/>
<br/>
Only a much better cake<br/>
than you've ever had.<br/>
<br/>
Look, an old press, an antique.<br/>
<br/>
Now we put it in the oven.<br/>
<br/>
Here's one.<br/>
The other will follow.<br/>
<br/>
All natural, organic and healthy.<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
- we'll take a kilo.<br/>
- A whole kilo. Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
- No.<br/>
- You said a kilo.<br/>
<br/>
We'll take five.<br/>
<br/>
How do we get five across the border?<br/>
<br/>
That's Gustavo's department.<br/>
<br/>
This one has got a good engine.<br/>
<br/>
I was taking a look at it,<br/>
and the best place to hide the merchandise<br/>
<br/>
would be under the rear wheel well.<br/>
<br/>
It's 22 and one half horsepower.<br/>
<br/>
Is this easy to take off?<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about that shit.<br/>
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.<br/>
<br/>
All right, all right.<br/>
I'll take three cars, please.<br/>
<br/>
- Sure, when do you need them?<br/>
- Now, brother.<br/>
<br/>
All right, we'll take the cars<br/>
and head back to the lab.<br/>
<br/>
Why the f*ck<br/>
are we going back to the lab?<br/>
<br/>
Because there are four wheel wells per car<br/>
and that's 20 kilos.<br/>
<br/>
For three cars, that's 60 kilos.<br/>
<br/>
So if it's nine dollars<br/>
profit per gram, what?<br/>
<br/>
$9,000 per kilo.<br/>
<br/>
$9,000 times 60...<br/>
The profit is $540,000.<br/>
<br/>
That's it!<br/>
<br/>
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.<br/>
<br/>
That's half a million dollars... per trip,<br/>
<br/>
using the same smuggling routes<br/>
he always used.<br/>
<br/>
Easiest money he ever made.<br/>
<br/>
Back in Medell?n,<br/>
Pablo didn't waste any time.<br/>
<br/>
He bought a house<br/>
in his old neighborhood<br/>
<br/>
and opened his first lab to turn<br/>
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.<br/>
<br/>
How are you feeling, Gustavo?<br/>
<br/>
All this smells like shit to me.<br/>
<br/>
What an ignorant bastard.<br/>
It's like French cheese.<br/>
<br/>
The stinkier, the better.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
What about all these lights?<br/>
<br/>
Is that to tip off the cops,<br/>
or what?<br/>
<br/>
Just worry about transporting the stuff<br/>
and selling it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the artist here, clear?<br/>
<br/>
Clear.<br/>
<br/>
- Right?<br/>
- Yeah. Mm-mm.<br/>
<br/>
It was a mom-and-pop operation,<br/>
so small they called it The Kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
But make no mistake,<br/>
it would change Medell?n forever.<br/>
<br/>
You know the thing<br/>
that has me worried, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Don't you think the workers<br/>
will choke with all that smoke?<br/>
<br/>
Let's build them a chimney.<br/>
<br/>
There you go.<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, the first three?<br/>
<br/>
If this business makes so much money,<br/>
why are you sending me coach?<br/>
<br/>
We just started up.<br/>
We have to be careful with money.<br/>
<br/>
- Don't be a dick.<br/>
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.<br/>
<br/>
- Come on.<br/>
- How much can a first class ticket cost?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
Why don't you buy it yourself?<br/>
<br/>
Like her son, Pablo's mother<br/>
Hermilda was very resourceful.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Mom,<br/>
how much do you think we can fit in there?<br/>
<br/>
- Around five kilos, honey.<br/>
- That much?<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, Pablito.<br/>
<br/>
I love it. Let's do it.<br/>
<br/>
- Pablo.<br/>
- Thank you, my love.<br/>
<br/>
It's Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Five kilos, right?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo loved his young bride Tata,<br/>
and she loved him.<br/>
<br/>
He was a family man till the end.<br/>
<br/>
The guy they got to wear the jacket<br/>
was the Lion.<br/>
<br/>
- Meet my friend.<br/>
- Hello, how are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.<br/>
<br/>
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd<br/>
spent his childhood in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Says he wants to fly first class.<br/>
It's not like we're rich, right?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.<br/>
How are you?<br/>
<br/>
- Lion.<br/>
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.<br/>
<br/>
Here's three.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to need two more,<br/>
right, Mom?<br/>
<br/>
- That's right.<br/>
- Pablito...<br/>
<br/>
make sure it is not you<br/>
who wears it, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Look, my love...<br/>
it won't fit me.<br/>
<br/>
Try it on.<br/>
<br/>
Come here.<br/>
<br/>
That's it.<br/>
<br/>
Good, right?<br/>
<br/>
One...<br/>
<br/>
- two...<br/>
- Wow, it holds a lot!<br/>
<br/>
Three.<br/>
<br/>
- Two more.<br/>
- Got it. I'll be right back.<br/>
<br/>
He looks really handsome,<br/>
doesn't he?<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Lion,<br/>
that jacket fits you very nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust<br/>
the jacket a little bit here in the back?<br/>
<br/>
- Aah!<br/>
- Listen to this guy.<br/>
<br/>
He looks very handsome, son.<br/>
<br/>
Like a f*g model, isn't that right?<br/>
<br/>
The Lion was one of the first guys<br/>
to ever bring coke into Miami.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Have a great day.<br/>
<br/>
Next, please.<br/>
<br/>
His contact was a crazy nut job<br/>
named Carlos Lehder,<br/>
<br/>
half Colombian, half German,<br/>
and 100 percent playboy.<br/>
<br/>
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf h*tler.<br/>
<br/>
Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Back in '79, this piece of work<br/>
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia<br/>
<br/>
on a fleet of small planes.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
- What's up, son?<br/>
<br/>
- Welcome.<br/>
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?<br/>
<br/>
- Everything good?<br/>
- Everything's good.<br/>
<br/>
Whoo! It's so hot.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell are you doing<br/>
with a jacket on?<br/>
<br/>
You like my jacket, brother?<br/>
<br/>
I got it in Colombia and look,<br/>
it has a little gift.<br/>
<br/>
I was in jail for a while, remember?<br/>
<br/>
I saw this shit there.<br/>
It's pure poison.<br/>
<br/>
What you got there<br/>
is the perfect product.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo says the gringos<br/>
will fall in love with this shit.<br/>
<br/>
It's gonna f*ck up their brains,<br/>
that's for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
Go on. There are five kilos.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you going?<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna get another jacket,<br/>
brother.<br/>
<br/>
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,<br/>
all right?<br/>
<br/>
The Lion made more than 20 flights<br/>
between Medell?n and Miami.<br/>
<br/>
Drugs in, cash out.<br/>
<br/>
And the rich and famous in Miami<br/>
snorted every single gram of it.<br/>
<br/>
And in no time,<br/>
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo had the trucks<br/>
filled to the brim with potatoes,<br/>
<br/>
the major item<br/>
Colombia imported from Peru.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.<br/>
<br/>
The coke paste<br/>
was hidden in the spare tires.<br/>
<br/>
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.<br/>
<br/>
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,<br/>
going back and forth every day...<br/>
<br/>
You do the math.<br/>
No way the Lion could transport it all.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon,<br/>
the Lion had to come up with new ways<br/>
<br/>
to smuggle the drug to Miami.<br/>
<br/>
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?<br/>
<br/>
You guys are pilots,<br/>
<br/>
so you can get this stuff by<br/>
without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,<br/>
so whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
We'll take four.<br/>
<br/>
All right, much better.<br/>
<br/>
Take these two and tell Jairo<br/>
to give you two more. All right?<br/>
<br/>
- All right.<br/>
- Perfect. Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
- See you later.<br/>
- Later.<br/>
<br/>
Come in, please.<br/>
<br/>
Look, here are the packets.<br/>
<br/>
You take a packet...<br/>
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.<br/>
<br/>
Easy, right?<br/>
<br/>
You swallow 50,<br/>
and I pay you $10,000.<br/>
<br/>
All right?<br/>
<br/>
But with you two,<br/>
we have a problem.<br/>
<br/>
You girls are pregnant, right?<br/>
<br/>
That's good, because US Customs<br/>
won't search pregnant women.<br/>
<br/>
You two can easily swallow 70<br/>
instead of 50.<br/>
<br/>
And I'll pay you $15,000<br/>
to help you with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
All right? All right. Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
During the early '80s,<br/>
most flights out of Bogot?<br/>
<br/>
had several mules on them.<br/>
<br/>
They didn't even know about each other.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what?<br/>
<br/>
Getting in was easy, because nobody<br/>
worried about cocaine in America.<br/>
<br/>
All we cared about was grass.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in<br/>
almost every legitimate Colombian export.<br/>
<br/>
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
But even that didn't do it.<br/>
<br/>
The real game changer was filling<br/>
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.<br/>
<br/>
Do you trust this guy?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
He was in prison in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
- So is he gay or what?<br/>
- Oh, for sure he's gay.<br/>
<br/>
But he's got good routes.<br/>
<br/>
- Amigos!<br/>
- Hello, Carlos.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo Gaviria,<br/>
nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
- Nice to meet you.<br/>
- My cousin.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.<br/>
Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.<br/>
- How was your flight?<br/>
<br/>
Smooth.<br/>
<br/>
Let's get down to business.<br/>
<br/>
The Lion tells us you've been transporting<br/>
a lot of marijuana in your plane.<br/>
<br/>
- That's true.<br/>
- About how much per flight?<br/>
<br/>
- How far?<br/>
- Miami.<br/>
<br/>
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.<br/>
- 1000 kilos?<br/>
<br/>
Counting the gasoline.<br/>
<br/>
Carlos...<br/>
<br/>
Yes?<br/>
<br/>
What if we take out the seats,<br/>
the carpet and all the other crap<br/>
<br/>
and only leave space for the pilot?<br/>
Can you fit more?<br/>
<br/>
We'll leave the engine, right?<br/>
<br/>
How much more?<br/>
<br/>
About... 300 more.<br/>
<br/>
All right then, Mr. Carlos.<br/>
Let's take a walk.<br/>
<br/>
Within months after meeting Cockroach,<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated<br/>
narco routes from Colombia to America.<br/>
<br/>
It was a real milestone<br/>
in the story of narcotics, folks.<br/>
<br/>
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen<br/>
and started opening cocaine labs<br/>
<br/>
in the middle of the jungle.<br/>
<br/>
Under the canopy cover<br/>
of the Colombian rainforest,<br/>
<br/>
he could expand his production capability<br/>
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.<br/>
<br/>
We brought you a little present.<br/>
<br/>
Brazilians.<br/>
<br/>
Best asses in the world,<br/>
believe me.<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm not feeling well.<br/>
<br/>
- What's up, Cuca?<br/>
- Hello.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
What the f*ck is up with you guys?<br/>
<br/>
You're flying around in planes...<br/>
<br/>
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?<br/>
- Look, Cuca...<br/>
<br/>
Look, let us explain what we have to...<br/>
<br/>
Wait.<br/>
<br/>
From now on,<br/>
in all of my labs...<br/>
<br/>
I'll build a large house<br/>
with air-conditioning, with a pool...<br/>
<br/>
- And whores from Brazil.<br/>
- And whores from Brazil.<br/>
<br/>
- Just for you.<br/>
- One problem.<br/>
<br/>
These are my labs. Mm?<br/>
<br/>
Relax.<br/>
No one's arguing with you.<br/>
<br/>
Come show me the production<br/>
and we'll talk later.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo couldn't hide his success<br/>
from his friends.<br/>
<br/>
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.<br/>
<br/>
Guys used to getting what they want,<br/>
one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
How something like this<br/>
can make so much money!<br/>
<br/>
Now I ask myself...<br/>
if I should get involved with this.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
I heard the ""potato"" business<br/>
is like the ""egg"" business.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't get involved.<br/>
<br/>
Look, man,<br/>
I took a good look at the market.<br/>
<br/>
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.<br/>
<br/>
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.<br/>
- Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful, guys. If we all start<br/>
buying potatoes at the same time,<br/>
<br/>
the Peruvians will raise the price.<br/>
<br/>
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.<br/>
<br/>
We can reduce the cost of<br/>
the refining process if we buy together.<br/>
<br/>
Well, guys, the hard part<br/>
is getting the merchandise to Miami.<br/>
<br/>
You need a lot of creativity for that.<br/>
<br/>
How much would you charge us<br/>
to be ""creative""?<br/>
<br/>
You deliver the product to me, labeled.<br/>
<br/>
I will take it to Miami<br/>
and deliver it to your contact there.<br/>
<br/>
Better yet, Lehder will do it.<br/>
<br/>
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,<br/>
<br/>
but I'll insure the safety of your load<br/>
up to 50 percent of the value.<br/>
<br/>
The potato business is ours.<br/>
We don't need...<br/>
<br/>
Deal?<br/>
<br/>
Deal.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good to me.<br/>
<br/>
All right,<br/>
I will create my own routes<br/>
<br/>
and stop using your services<br/>
as soon as possible. OK?<br/>
<br/>
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.<br/>
<br/>
Partners?<br/>
<br/>
We know your policy toward partners.<br/>
<br/>
Let's just call us...<br/>
<br/>
""friendly associates.""<br/>
<br/>
To Miami.<br/>
<br/>
To Miami!<br/>
<br/>
When I started, a one-kilo<br/>
grass bust was cause for celebration.<br/>
<br/>
And before long,<br/>
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.<br/>
<br/>
We thought we were<br/>
making a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
Truth is,<br/>
we weren't even making a dent.<br/>
<br/>
They let us have 60<br/>
so they could bring in 600.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo's coke flooded in.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't take long<br/>
for Miami to get addicted.<br/>
<br/>
And I mean that.<br/>
<br/>
It was like the whole city was<br/>
running around trying to get this shit.<br/>
<br/>
And with the money...<br/>
<br/>
came the v*olence.<br/>
<br/>
The hippies had been<br/>
replaced by Colombians,<br/>
<br/>
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.<br/>
<br/>
The Miami coroner<br/>
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.<br/>
<br/>
Use 'em once,<br/>
then throw 'em away.<br/>
<br/>
The Dade County morgue couldn't<br/>
fit all the bodies from the drug w*r.<br/>
<br/>
They had to rent a refrigerated truck<br/>
from a local company<br/>
<br/>
to hold all the extra corpses.<br/>
<br/>
That was the first person I ever sh*t.<br/>
<br/>
A teenager not old enough<br/>
to buy a six-pack.<br/>
<br/>
Hey... it was self-defense.<br/>
<br/>
- Kevin called you?<br/>
- He's worried about you.<br/>
<br/>
Did he forget to tell you<br/>
the kid was 17?<br/>
<br/>
He sells drugs, right?<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- Yeah, then f*ck him.<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
- Coming through!<br/>
- I was about to finish my shift<br/>
<br/>
when we got hit<br/>
with the lights and sirens.<br/>
<br/>
Stay with me.<br/>
<br/>
I have an unconscious pregnant female.<br/>
<br/>
Paramedics said she collapsed<br/>
after she got off her flight.<br/>
<br/>
By the time she got to us,<br/>
she was barely breathing.<br/>
<br/>
- Pressure 60 over 40.<br/>
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.<br/>
<br/>
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...<br/>
<br/>
but she had no residue on her nostrils,<br/>
no injection marks.<br/>
<br/>
We did everything we could.<br/>
<br/>
She died in the ER.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to save the baby...<br/>
<br/>
The baby died in my hands.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry.<br/>
<br/>
She was body-packing<br/>
11 ounces of cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
Two of the pellets split open.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.<br/>
<br/>
No one survives that.<br/>
<br/>
Why won't Pablo ever see me?<br/>
<br/>
I spent all this time<br/>
waiting around for him.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me something, Cockroach.<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever think<br/>
you were going to have this much money?<br/>
<br/>
f*ck the money.<br/>
I'm talking renegotiation.<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn't for me, you two<br/>
would still be smuggling cigarettes.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you a piece of advice.<br/>
<br/>
Never say that to Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
He's not as forgiving as I am.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo was f*cking Cockroach over.<br/>
<br/>
But Cockroach<br/>
should've listened to Gustavo.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, he found another way<br/>
to get his fair share.<br/>
<br/>
Stop!<br/>
<br/>
What do you have in the spare tires?<br/>
<br/>
390 kilos, Pablo. We lost it.<br/>
<br/>
Gustavo, what do you mean<br/>
""we lost it""?<br/>
<br/>
Just what I said, we lost it.<br/>
<br/>
We lost it? It just disappeared?<br/>
Into thin air or what?<br/>
<br/>
Don't mess with me, Pablo.<br/>
We lost it.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the cops must have stopped<br/>
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.<br/>
<br/>
Look...<br/>
<br/>
we've paid every cop<br/>
from here to Ipsalia.<br/>
<br/>
So how did we lose a load, brother?<br/>
<br/>
It looks like Colonel Herrera<br/>
suddenly turned honest.<br/>
<br/>
Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
And how much is he asking?<br/>
<br/>
Too much.<br/>
<br/>
What are you going to do?<br/>
<br/>
Come back, Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
Don't go and risk it for this assh*le.<br/>
Come back.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you going, Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
Pablo?<br/>
<br/>
What's going on, brother?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Escobar...<br/>
<br/>
- we need to renegotiate.<br/>
- Eat shit.<br/>
<br/>
Eat. Shit.<br/>
<br/>
What if I sh*t you in the head?<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure about this, Colonel?<br/>
<br/>
He hasn't stopped laughing<br/>
since we arrested him.<br/>
<br/>
We're DAS, Ibarra.<br/>
<br/>
What's that f*g gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
There we are.<br/>
<br/>
No, lower, lower.<br/>
<br/>
No that low.<br/>
<br/>
Ready.<br/>
<br/>
Another one, another one.<br/>
I'm ready.<br/>
<br/>
Pablo didn't know it then...<br/>
<br/>
but this mug sh*t was gonna cause him<br/>
a lot of grief down the line.<br/>
<br/>
Remove the handcuffs.<br/>
<br/>
You can go now, officer.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.<br/>
<br/>
We counted more than 300 kilos<br/>
in those trucks.<br/>
<br/>
That's a street value<br/>
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.<br/>
<br/>
And you only gave us $150,000.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's what we agreed upon.<br/>
<br/>
You know something?<br/>
<br/>
I make deals for a living.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can either accept my deal<br/>
or accept the consequences. You decide.<br/>
<br/>
Or we can renegotiate,<br/>
come to an agreement,<br/>
<br/>
and everyone goes home happy.<br/>
<br/>
Deal?<br/>
<br/>
I'll give you one million dollars...<br/>
<br/>
under one condition.<br/>
<br/>
What is it?<br/>
<br/>
Someone in my organization<br/>
gave you the street value of my cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, how would you know?<br/>
<br/>
Give me a name...<br/>
<br/>
and you won't have<br/>
to split the cash with him.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did he sell Pablo<br/>
to the authorities,<br/>
<br/>
he was stealing from him all along<br/>
and selling his coke in Miami, too.<br/>
<br/>
Cockroach's dealer was Germ?n Zapata,<br/>
a Colombian with a plumbing business<br/>
<br/>
that served as a front<br/>
for his cocaine operation.<br/>
<br/>
He had 1200 keys in the van...<br/>
and guess who was buying the load?<br/>
<br/>
The plan was to trade vehicles,<br/>
<br/>
and Zapata would be arrested<br/>
once he left the port.<br/>
<br/>
1200 kilos.<br/>
<br/>
That would get us<br/>
on the cover of the Miami Herald.<br/>
<br/>
OK, gringos.<br/>
<br/>
How's the plumbing business?<br/>
<br/>
Fine.<br/>
<br/>
- How's it look?<br/>
- Plumbing business is very good.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, amigo. I'll show you.<br/>
<br/>
Everything was going perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, amigo...<br/>
100 percent pure.<br/>
<br/>
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.<br/>
<br/>
Got a full load here, Murph...<br/>
<br/>
Don't move! Don't move.<br/>
<br/>
Don't move! Don't move.<br/>
<br/>
Get down!<br/>
<br/>
Hands! Down!<br/>
<br/>
Don't look at me.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking...<br/>
<br/>
In the case of<br/>
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego D?az,<br/>
<br/>
after taking into account<br/>
all due considerations,<br/>
<br/>
bail has been set at two million dollars,<br/>
or a bond of $200,000.<br/>
<br/>
I got to the courthouse early<br/>
the day of La Quica's trial.<br/>
<br/>
My testimony was gonna<br/>
put that bastard on death row.<br/>
<br/>
The US District Attorney said La Quica<br/>
met his bail of two million dollars,<br/>
<br/>
paid by a wire transfer from, well...<br/>
why don't you take a guess?<br/>
<br/>
La Quica boarded<br/>
and was back in Medell?n by midnight.<br/>
<br/>
From '79 to '84,<br/>
there were 3,245 m*rder in Miami.<br/>
<br/>
And outside the Tourist Bureau<br/>
and the cops,<br/>
<br/>
no one much cared about that.<br/>
<br/>
What got the US government<br/>
to take notice was the money.<br/>
<br/>
Billions of dollars a year,<br/>
all flowing from the US to Colombia.<br/>
<br/>
And that... America couldn't take.<br/>
<br/>
A group of powerful businessmen<br/>
went and met with President Reagan.<br/>
<br/>
They were terrified the narco economy<br/>
would sink the real economy of Miami.<br/>
<br/>
Or... maybe they were pissed off<br/>
that they weren't getting a cut.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it was, the businessmen<br/>
came at just the right time.<br/>
<br/>
It's back-to-school time<br/>
for America's children...<br/>
<br/>
It was time for America<br/>
to suit up against a new enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Drugs are menacing our society.<br/>
<br/>
They're thr*at our values<br/>
and undercutting our institutions.<br/>
<br/>
They're k*ll our children.<br/>
<br/>
It was classic Reagan.<br/>
<br/>
Folksy, direct and tough.<br/>
<br/>
He vowed to go after drugs<br/>
at the source.<br/>
<br/>
But it was Nancy who stole the show.<br/>
<br/>
So to my young friends out there,<br/>
life can be great.<br/>
<br/>
But not when you can't see it.<br/>
<br/>
So open your eyes to life, to see it<br/>
in the vivid colors that God gave us<br/>
<br/>
as a precious gift to His children.<br/>
<br/>
Say yes to your life.<br/>
<br/>
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...<br/>
just say no.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no! No, Pablo, no, no!<br/>
<br/>
No, no!<br/>
<br/>
They say when a nuclear holocaust<br/>
destroys the world,<br/>
<br/>
only the cockroaches will survive.<br/>
<br/>
Leave that piece of shit there.<br/>
<br/>
I guess they were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
During his career,<br/>
Pablo would k*ll over a thousand cops.<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn't learn that till later.<br/>
<br/>
My dad volunteered to fight<br/>
in World w*r II because of Pearl Harbor.<br/>
<br/>
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?<br/>
<br/>
No way.<br/>
<br/>
He was a West Virginia farm boy,<br/>
but these f*ck stepped on our soil.<br/>
<br/>
So he laced up his army boots<br/>
and went to fight.<br/>
<br/>
It was his duty.<br/>
<br/>
Cocaine in Miami?<br/>
<br/>
Kilos from Colombia?<br/>
<br/>
This was my w*r.<br/>
<br/>
This was my duty.<br/>
<br/>
And I was ready to fight it.<br/>
<br/>
And my wife was ready<br/>
to fight it with me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Your ticket, please.<br/>
<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
We had no idea<br/>
what we were in for.<br/>
<br/>
One year later... all that patriotic<br/>
bullshit was right out the window.<br/>
<br/>
OK, man, what do we got?<br/>
<br/>
- We got Poison...<br/>
- Excellent. Who else?<br/>
<br/>
We got Lizard.<br/>
<br/>
Uh...<br/>
<br/>
We got, we got...<br/>
<br/>
- Big Badmouth.<br/>
- That f*ck.<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you for the gift, agent.<br/>
- No problem.<br/>
<br/>
If there's one thing<br/>
I've learned in the narco world,<br/>
<br/>
it's that life is more complicated<br/>
than you think.<br/>
<br/>
Good and bad...<br/>
they're relative concepts.<br/>
<br/>
In the world of drug dealers,<br/>
you do what you think is right...<br/>
<br/>
and hope for the best.<br/>
<br/>
Look at what happened, boss.<br/>
<br/>
They k*ll Poison at La Dispensaria.<br/>
<br/>
- Who did it?<br/>
- I think it was Carrillo.<br/>
<br/>
And there was a gringo DEA agent<br/>
taking pictures.<br/>
<br/>
- Raise the bounty.<br/>
- On Carrillo, sir?<br/>
<br/>
I'll pay half a million<br/>
for the head of a DEA agent.<br/>
<br/>
Half a million?<br/>
<br/>
Do it.<br/>
<br/>
As you wish, sir.<br/>
<br/>
f*cking gringos.</div>]","Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.

They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

and trust me,
they know who you're f*cking.

You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

First off,
there was no Internet.

No cells.

The best they had were satellite phones,

and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

the landowners, the politicians...

And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

What's up, Lizard?

We're going out tonight.

And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

the voices of our targets.

I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

No GPS either.

Hammer, prepare to engage.

Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

La Dispensaria.

I've got a table ready.

Show up around midnight.

- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it,

but he'd just made himself a date.

Negative on Hammer. This f*ck
just told us where he's going.

Hammer, disengage.

So who do we give this to? DEA?

- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Pe?a.
- Pe?a's an assh*le.

- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

By ""the other guy,"" he meant me.

I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.

And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

Hello?

Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

Got it.

He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

OK.

I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

Hola.

La Dispensaria?

All right.

Guess who that was.

Your partner.

He just gave me a great gift.

Poison.

Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

Yeah, sure.

He's not a fool.

Gotta go.

Gonna stick me with the bill?

Cheap son of a bitch.

In case you're wondering,
this is the assh*le.

Javier Pe?a, my partner.

And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,

the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

Especially the local hitmen.

Colombians call them sicarios.

- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

Let's go inside and have a good time.

Now, Poison, he was one of the best.

Crazy f*ck
who k*ll dozens of people.

Probably hundreds.

But don't get me wrong.

I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never k*ll a fly.

I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

It's on, boys!

We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

We're gonna k*ll these f*ck,
all right?

Yes, sir!

I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

Yeah, I pushed the buttons.

But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

My fellow Americans...

Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

We thought he was one of the good guys.

And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

because he hated the commies.

So we helped Pinochet seize power.

Then Pinochet turned around
and k*ll thousands of people.

Maybe not such a good guy after all.

But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.

Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way

to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

to ship the product north.

To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!

You're surrounded!

- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

But Pinochet spoiled the party.

What the f*ck is going on here?

On the ground!

He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

And then, being Pinochet...

he had them all k*ll.

Attention!

w*apon ready!

Aim!

Ready amm*nit*on!

f*re!

They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,

only the cockroaches will survive.

I guess they were right.

The b*ll*ts missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,

and he was smart enough to play d*ad.

He wasn't k*ll on that day.

Instead, he won the damn lottery.

Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

f*cking Pinochet
is k*ll the whole world.

- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.

A drug tr*ffick.

- A drug tr*ffick?
- Yes, a drug tr*ffick.

Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

on the human brain.

We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

This will give us better results, OK?

Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

unless we're talking about cocaine.

Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

Gracias.

And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.

And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.

A typical Colombian smuggling family.

- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

But Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

Another possible partner
was Jos? Rodr?guez Gacha,

nicknamed ""The Mexican,""
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

If you make it to the top...

it means you've k*ll your enemies.

Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

And sometimes, your partners.

Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

A man Cockroach knew would be just right.

Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

The man who would
change my life forever.

Pablo was making a k*ll
in the smuggling business.

Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medell?n.

But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

They didn't play by the same rules.

Good day.

Pablo Escobar?

Where's Felipo?

Felipo's been arrested.

Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the f*ck up.

- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

Show some respect.

Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

How do you know my name?

You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

And that's Nacho Ibarra.

There's Garcia, Lopez...

- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

Pinilla...

and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the f*cking trucks.

I don't have all day.

Open it.

Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

Who the f*ck do you think you are?

You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

Oh, yeah? You don't say.

Where are your import papers?

You need papers for these TV sets.

Take them.

Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medell?n police making a shit salary.

- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

It's for Carlitos.

Your son.

Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

Hey, Pinilla!

Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

What's she doing with a guy like you?

I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

Colonel, how is your mom doing?

- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- Yes.

Gentlemen...

I'm going to tell you who I am.

I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

My eyes are everywhere.

That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

without me knowing about it.

Do you understand? Not a finger.

One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

So look, I make deals for a living.

Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

or accept the consequences.

Silver...

or lead.

You decide.

- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.

Yo, Pablo!

- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

No, no, no.
""Cockroach"" to my friends.

All right,
yesterday we were talking,

and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

Explain.

Well... I get the paste in Peru.

I will handle
the chemical part of production,

and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

Now tell him how much it costs.

In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

Also...

it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

we can find room on our trucks.

We can sell it in Bogot?, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

We're going to be rich.

- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

Well look, Cuca...

you don't have any vision,
my friend.

If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

I love that song.

Rodrigo! One more.

Back then, Miami was a paradise.

I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

DEA! Stop!

I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.

Kevin was a little slow afoot.

Why you running, huh?

What you got? What is this? Huh?

What is that?

That right there...
that's a g*dd*mn promotion.

Let's go celebrate.

- Whoo!
- Look at that.

Go! Go! Go!

How you like me now?

How much money you owe me?

What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

That's right, that's right.

All right.
All right, who do we pick?

How 'bout her?

No, no, no,
we gotta f*ck with him.

- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

- All right.
- Whoo!

Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

Oh, she was checking out your ass.

Get the f*ck outta here.
Come on.

Listen, she eye-f*cked you
the entire time you were bowling.

She was. She was eye-f*cking you.
The entire time.

I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

You dicking me around?

f*ck it, I'm going in.

- Go get her.
- Mm!

- Yup.
- Hey, while you're up there,

get us another pitcher, will ya?

- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

How you doing?

Busy.

I just said, ""Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.""

No one's forcing you to do anything.""
So, I don't know...

Yeah, those bastards got me.

But I couldn't let it end like that.

Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

Uh, they're f*cking with me.

Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

You're a cop?

Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

Drug Enforcement?

So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

Come on, why don't you do me a favor?

I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

give me your phone number?

How about a fake number?

That'll work.

Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

Have a good night.

Aah...

sh*t down!

- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

How much did that cost you?

- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

I figured, what the hell.

Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

Hello?

So it wasn't a fake.

I thought you might figure it out.

After all, you're DEA.

And just like that... she had me.

The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

cocaine had him.

It's been a while.

These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

Would you like a little coffee?

Yeah, a coffee?

Yes, a coffee.

- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

You sure?

My factory is small,
but highly productive.

Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

Little magic leaves.

The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

Let it dry, dry, dry.

You use ammonia to get the paste.

And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

Here is the prize.

It's like the kitchen in your house.

Like baking a cake.

Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

Look, an old press, an antique.

Now we put it in the oven.

Here's one.
The other will follow.

All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

Well...

- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

- No.
- You said a kilo.

We'll take five.

How do we get five across the border?

That's Gustavo's department.

This one has got a good engine.

I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

would be under the rear wheel well.

It's 22 and one half horsepower.

Is this easy to take off?

Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

Why the f*ck
are we going back to the lab?

Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

For three cars, that's 60 kilos.

So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

$9,000 per kilo.

$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

That's it!

- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

That's half a million dollars... per trip,

using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

Easiest money he ever made.

Back in Medell?n,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

How are you feeling, Gustavo?

All this smells like shit to me.

What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

The stinkier, the better.

All right.

What about all these lights?

Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

I'm the artist here, clear?

Clear.

- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.

But make no mistake,
it would change Medell?n forever.

You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

Let's build them a chimney.

There you go.

Gentlemen, the first three?

If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

Trust me, Pablito.

I love it. Let's do it.

- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

It's Gustavo.

Five kilos, right?

Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.

He was a family man till the end.

The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

Here's three.

We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

- That's right.
- Pablito...

make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

Look, my love...
it won't fit me.

Try it on.

Come here.

That's it.

Good, right?

One...

- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

Three.

- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

He looks very handsome, son.

Like a f*g model, isn't that right?

The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

Welcome to the United States.

Thank you. Have a great day.

Next, please.

His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf h*tler.

Go figure.

Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

on a fleet of small planes.

- What's up?
- What's up, son?

- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

Whoo! It's so hot.

What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

You like my jacket, brother?

I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

I was in jail for a while, remember?

I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

What you got there
is the perfect product.

Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

It's gonna f*ck up their brains,
that's for sure.

Yes, sir.

Here you go.

Go on. There are five kilos.

Where are you going?

I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medell?n and Miami.

Drugs in, cash out.

And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways

to smuggle the drug to Miami.

The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

You guys are pilots,

so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

We'll take four.

All right, much better.

Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

- See you later.
- Later.

Come in, please.

Look, here are the packets.

You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

Easy, right?

You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

All right?

But with you two,
we have a problem.

You girls are pregnant, right?

That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

All right? All right. Perfect.

During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogot?

had several mules on them.

They didn't even know about each other.

And you know what?

Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

All we cared about was grass.

Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.

But even that didn't do it.

The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

Do you trust this guy?

I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

But he's got good routes.

- Amigos!
- Hello, Carlos.

Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

Smooth.

Let's get down to business.

The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

- How far?
- Miami.

- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

Counting the gasoline.

Carlos...

Yes?

What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

We'll leave the engine, right?

How much more?

About... 300 more.

All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

Within months after meeting Cockroach,

Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

in the middle of the jungle.

Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

We brought you a little present.

Brazilians.

Best asses in the world,
believe me.

No, I'm not feeling well.

- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

Hey, Gustavo.

What the f*ck is up with you guys?

You're flying around in planes...

- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca...

Look, let us explain what we have to...

Wait.

From now on,
in all of my labs...

I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

- And whores from Brazil.
- And whores from Brazil.

- Just for you.
- One problem.

These are my labs. Mm?

Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

How something like this
can make so much money!

Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

What do you think, Pablo?

I heard the ""potato"" business
is like the ""egg"" business.

I wouldn't get involved.

Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

the Peruvians will raise the price.

They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

You need a lot of creativity for that.

How much would you charge us
to be ""creative""?

You deliver the product to me, labeled.

I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

Better yet, Lehder will do it.

I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

The potato business is ours.
We don't need...

Deal?

Deal.

Sounds good to me.

All right,
I will create my own routes

and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

Partners?

We know your policy toward partners.

Let's just call us...

""friendly associates.""

To Miami.

To Miami!

When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

We thought we were
making a huge difference.

Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

Pablo's coke flooded in.

It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

And I mean that.

It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

And with the money...

came the v*olence.

The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.

The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug w*r.

They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

to hold all the extra corpses.

That was the first person I ever sh*t.

A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

Hey... it was self-defense.

- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

He sells drugs, right?

- Yeah.
- Yeah, then f*ck him.

What happened?

- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

Stay with me.

I have an unconscious pregnant female.

Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.

- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.

I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.

We did everything we could.

She died in the ER.

We tried to save the baby...

The baby died in my hands.

I'm so sorry.

She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

Two of the pellets split open.

Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

No one survives that.

Why won't Pablo ever see me?

I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

Tell me something, Cockroach.

Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

f*ck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

Let me give you a piece of advice.

Never say that to Pablo.

He's not as forgiving as I am.

Pablo was f*cking Cockroach over.

But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

Stop!

What do you have in the spare tires?

390 kilos, Pablo. We lost it.

Gustavo, what do you mean
""we lost it""?

Just what I said, we lost it.

We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

Look...

we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

So how did we lose a load, brother?

It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

Know what I mean?

And how much is he asking?

Too much.

What are you going to do?

Come back, Pablo.

Don't go and risk it for this assh*le.
Come back.

Where are you going, Pablo?

Pablo?

What's going on, brother?

Mr. Escobar...

- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

Eat. Shit.

What if I sh*t you in the head?

Are you sure about this, Colonel?

He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

We're DAS, Ibarra.

What's that f*g gonna do?

There we are.

No, lower, lower.

No that low.

Ready.

Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

Pablo didn't know it then...

but this mug sh*t was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

Remove the handcuffs.

You can go now, officer.

Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

And you only gave us $150,000.

Well, that's what we agreed upon.

You know something?

I make deals for a living.

Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

and everyone goes home happy.

Deal?

I'll give you one million dollars...

under one condition.

What is it?

Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

Otherwise, how would you know?

Give me a name...

and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

Cockroach's dealer was Germ?n Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

The plan was to trade vehicles,

and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

1200 kilos.

That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

OK, gringos.

How's the plumbing business?

Fine.

- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

Come on, amigo. I'll show you.

Everything was going perfect.

Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

Got a full load here, Murph...

Don't move! Don't move.

Don't move! Don't move.

Get down!

Hands! Down!

Don't look at me.

f*cking...

In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego D?az,

after taking into account
all due considerations,

bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

La Quica boarded
and was back in Medell?n by midnight.

From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 m*rder in Miami.

And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

no one much cared about that.

What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

And that... America couldn't take.

A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

Drugs are menacing our society.

They're thr*at our values
and undercutting our institutions.

They're k*ll our children.

It was classic Reagan.

Folksy, direct and tough.

He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

But it was Nancy who stole the show.

So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

But not when you can't see it.

So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

as a precious gift to His children.

Say yes to your life.

And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

No, no, no! No, Pablo, no, no!

No, no!

They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

only the cockroaches will survive.

Leave that piece of shit there.

I guess they were wrong.

During his career,
Pablo would k*ll over a thousand cops.

But I wouldn't learn that till later.

My dad volunteered to fight
in World w*r II because of Pearl Harbor.

But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

No way.

He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these f*ck stepped on our soil.

So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

It was his duty.

Cocaine in Miami?

Kilos from Colombia?

This was my w*r.

This was my duty.

And I was ready to fight it.

And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

Your ticket, please.

OK.

We had no idea
what we were in for.

One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

OK, man, what do we got?

- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

We got Lizard.

Uh...

We got, we got...

- Big Badmouth.
- That f*ck.

- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

and hope for the best.

Look at what happened, boss.

They k*ll Poison at La Dispensaria.

- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

Half a million?

Do it.

As you wish, sir.

f*cking gringos."
