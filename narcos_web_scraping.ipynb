       " 'Amado Carrillo Fuentes!\\n\\nThe Lord of the Skies!\\n\\nHow f*cking elegant, f*ck.\\n\\n- Don\\'t tease. - God damn, f*ck.\\n\\n- Your little brother? - Yes. Alvaro.\\n\\nCome here, son.\\n\\n- You also get a hug. - Sir.\\n\\nHow are you doing?\\n\\n320 million kinds of okay.\\n\\nDoesn\\'t it smell like the f*cking U.S. Treasury in here?\\n\\n- This half is yours. - Yes?\\n\\nDon\\'t forget it.\\n\\nAll right. We came at a good time, then.\\n\\nA Tuesday like any other, Pacho. You know how it is.\\n\\nf*ck.\\n\\n- Let\\'s go to the house. - Let\\'s go.\\n\\nAll right. Son, do you like margaritas?\\n\\nOf course I do.\\n\\nGreat, because I have a Margarita for you.\\n\\nShe\\'ll suck you dry.\\n\\nWelcome to Mexico, f*ck.\\n\\nLet\\'s go.\\n\\nTake the money and destroy the plane.\\n\\nFirst off, Senator Martin and I would like to thank you\\n\\nfor having us down, Ambassador.\\n\\nBut, you gotta know what\\'s going on in Washington.\\n\\nFolks are wondering if we\\'re gonna win this thing.\\n\\nAnd as senior members of the Appropriations Committee,\\n\\nthose questions are directed at us.\\n\\nNow, everyone\\'s proud of the work you guys did to bring down Escobar.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s particularly an honor to meet you, Agent Peña.\\n\\nBut cocaine continues to flow north, and the American people wonder\\n\\nif the Colombians share our enthusiasm to take this thr*at head-on.\\n\\nOur colleague, Senator Helms, put forward some tough language on them.\\n\\nBut we wanted to come down here and get the real from you all.\\n\\nSee firsthand what\\'s at stake.\\n\\nSee how and... if we can give you all the support you need.\\n\\nLet\\'s extend the senators every courtesy while they\\'re here.\\n\\nTheir mission is a priority.\\n\\nThey ask... you answer.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMoney makes the world go \\'round.\\n\\nLegal or illegal, good guys and bad guys, we all chase money.\\n\\nFor the DEA, it\\'s about budget meetings and kissing the right ass\\n\\nto keep the funding flowing.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re a tr*ffick, getting the money is easy.\\n\\nIt\\'s holding onto it that\\'s hard.\\n\\nIn the early days, cash was flown back to Colombia\\n\\non the same planes that carried coke into the States.\\n\\nThen it was converted into pesos, or, if you were Pablo Escobar,\\n\\nstuck in a hole somewhere.\\n\\nOne tr*ffick died with so much cash buried on his property, when it rained,\\n\\nthe river downstream became clogged with bills that had washed free.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with illegal money is the trail that it leaves.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, American banks would take your money, no questions asked.\\n\\nThat changed when President Nixon signed the Bank Secrecy Act,\\n\\nrequiring all U.S. banks to report transactions\\n\\ninvolving more than $10,000 in cash.\\n\\nAnd from that law, money laundering was born.\\n\\nThe first stage of money laundering is called placement,\\n\\nand Cali had it down to an art.\\n\\nBringing workers from the comunas to the U.S.,\\n\\nwhere their job was to buy money orders,\\n\\neach just under ten grand, so they wouldn\\'t be reported.\\n\\nNo I.D. was required.\\n\\nAnd the orders could even remain blank until they were deposited or cashed.\\n\\nOnce they bought a bunch of money orders,\\n\\nthey packed them up and sent them south\\n\\nto a land of sunshine and lax oversight.\\n\\nPanama.\\n\\nSince they didn\\'t regulate wire transfers, Panama was the perfect place\\n\\nfor the second stage of money laundering: Layering.\\n\\nAnd here\\'s where the master goes to work.\\n\\nThe behind the scenes MVP of any drug cartel is the money launderer,\\n\\nthe guy that takes the dirty money and scrubs it clean. Here\\'s how:\\n\\nThe money orders were deposited into local bank accounts,\\n\\nand then bounced through shell companies and limited partnerships,\\n\\ncreating an untraceable web of phony purchase orders and transaction reports,\\n\\nwiping clean the money\\'s criminal origins.\\n\\nBut no matter how well you hide it, money always leaves a trail.\\n\\nAnd the best way to hurt the Cali cartel was to find it.\\n\\nCali. Muy hermosa, right?\\n\\nf*ck you, Chris.\\n\\nThe man asked me if I had a partner, and your desk is across from mine.\\n\\nYou really f*cked me, man.\\n\\nYou gonna ride a desk all the way to Special Operations Unit?\\n\\nYeah, as a matter of fact, I am.\\n\\nAgents Feistl, Van Ness...?\\n\\n- Feistl. - Welcome to Cali.\\n\\n- Gracias. - Captain Calderón.\\n\\nWe\\'re happy to be here.\\n\\nAnd what brings you to Cali?\\n\\nWe\\'ve got some addresses we want to investigate.\\n\\nCartel-related?\\n\\nNot necessarily.\\n\\nWhat a surprise. DEA agents that don\\'t trust us.\\n\\nHow did that work out for the last two guys?\\n\\nFriend, in Cali, there are more corrupt cops than there are churches.\\n\\nYou don\\'t trust me? I understand.\\n\\nBut if you want to get anything done in Cali, you need the police\\'s help.\\n\\nIf not me, someone else.\\n\\nNot my rule.\\n\\n- I understand. - Good.\\n\\nThe addresses are linked to cartel financial operations.\\n\\nWe want to put eyes on them. See if any of the dots start connecting...\\n\\nYou\\'ve come a long way to connect dots.\\n\\nWe work with what we\\'ve got.\\n\\nUnless you can tell me where I can find Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez.\\n\\nIf they didn\\'t own half of the city, I couldn\\'t even be sure they exist.\\n\\nThe Rodríguez brothers are ghosts.\\n\\nIt was true.\\n\\nWhile the terms of surrender were being finalized,\\n\\nthe brothers had gone underground to avoid capture.\\n\\nThey abandoned their swank estates, secretly moving to new homes,\\n\\nwhere they could continue running their empire\\n\\nwithout setting foot in one of their legitimate businesses.\\n\\nAnd all this while Chepe continued to expand their New York operation.\\n\\nBut sometimes, even the best get unlucky.\\n\\nA computer glitch in Monaco led authorities to notice\\n\\nthat one limited partnership had multiple accounts at the same bank.\\n\\nWhen they looked closer,\\n\\nthey found it had ties to hundreds of bullshit accounts across Europe.\\n\\nAnd they all led back to one bank...\\n\\nright here in Bogotá.\\n\\nLucky for us, the president had given the DEA our best w*apon yet:\\n\\nThe Clinton list.\\n\\nIf we suspected a company of working with tr*ffick,\\n\\ntheir name went on the list.\\n\\nAnd then they were banned from doing business with U.S. companies\\n\\nand U.S. companies were banned from doing business with them.\\n\\nYou get f*cked both ways.\\n\\nAnd you want to know what the best part is?\\n\\nWe don\\'t even have to prove it.\\n\\nWe just... put you on the list.\\n\\nAnd the OFAC takes care of the rest.\\n\\nHow can I help you, Agent Peña?\\n\\nArmed with the thr*at of the Clinton list,\\n\\nwe could get pretty much any information we wanted,\\n\\nand that\\'s how we were able to give.\\n\\nCali\\'s number one money launderer a name:\\n\\nFranklin Jurado.\\n\\nBecause it was illegal for Colombian citizens\\n\\nto have U.S. currency in their possession,\\n\\na money launderer became more than just a connection\\n\\nto the financial institutions that washed their cash.\\n\\nFor all intents and purposes, he is their money.\\n\\nJurado was the perfect bridge between the narcos\\n\\nand the world of high finance.\\n\\nHe spoke five languages and traveled on multiple passports.\\n\\nHe married an American girl he met while at business school in the States,\\n\\ntook her down south, and got her in on his action.\\n\\nThat American passport was solid gold in any Caribbean bank.\\n\\nJurado was smooth. But now, we knew his name.\\n\\nThese are cash transfers.\\n\\nThe accounts are controlled by a man named Franklin Jurado.\\n\\n- You know him? - Of him.\\n\\nHe served as director at Interamericas.\\n\\n- The Rodríguez brothers\\' bank. - Mm-hmm.\\n\\nThey later gave him a more important job.\\n\\nDo you have an address for Jurado?\\n\\nI can get it for you.\\n\\nSo what happened since the last time I saw you?\\n\\nAre you going to take these men on, or what?\\n\\n- I\\'m going to do my job. - And your bosses?\\n\\nDo they know what you\\'re doing?\\n\\nNo comment.\\n\\nI was thinking...\\n\\nmaybe I could come with you.\\n\\nOh, come on, this could be our last chance to travel like we used to.\\n\\n- Remember that place in Milan? - With the leaking roof?\\n\\nOn your birthday. And that terrible risotto.\\n\\nThat balcony.\\n\\nThe brothers are pushing now, baby. They are opening more accounts.\\n\\n- It\\'s dangerous. - I don\\'t care.\\n\\nHow high are you right now?\\n\\nHey, f*ck you!\\n\\nGive me your passport.\\n\\nI can\\'t stay in this apartment anymore, Franklin.\\n\\nI can\\'t watch another movie with subtitles by myself.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to listen to the cartel wives talk about their husbands...\\n\\n- With an English degree from Harvard... - Please don\\'t tell me I can teach.\\n\\nThen what did you want me to say?\\n\\nf*ck.\\n\\nWe\\'ll do this another time.\\n\\nThe dining room is over here.\\n\\nYou have a room over here.\\n\\nYou have another one over here.\\n\\nAnd here, you have the living room.\\n\\nThe dimmer is over here.\\n\\nAnd you can adjust the light.\\n\\nWell... you get the idea.\\n\\n- No. I don\\'t understand. - What don\\'t you understand?\\n\\nDoes this seem normal to you?\\n\\nYou indicated to Mr. Rodríguez\\n\\nyou were uncertain about returning to the North Valley.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why he bought me a palace. With dimmers.\\n\\nPlease tell Don Miguel thank you,\\n\\nbut I need to think about his generous offer.\\n\\nWe have that dinner tonight.\\n\\nWith your friends?\\n\\nWith the investors.\\n\\nThey\\'re not going to like the six-month delay.\\n\\nAnd I think it\\'s best if we don\\'t mention the Rodríguez brothers by name.\\n\\nI know you\\'re embarrassed by what I do.\\n\\nI know you did it for your family.\\n\\nBut if these people like everything they hear tonight,\\n\\nyou\\'ll have your own security firm the second these six months are up.\\n\\n- Ready! - Good!\\n\\nA choir!\\n\\nAll right, say bye to Dad. We\\'re leaving.\\n\\n- Bye. - Bye.\\n\\nAll right. Let\\'s go, or we\\'ll be late.\\n\\nWill you make it on time?\\n\\nIf you\\'re wearing the dress with the flowers, yes.\\n\\nLet\\'s go, girls.\\n\\nToday is a busy day for us, boys.\\n\\nBosses have meetings all day at the National Hotel.\\n\\nI need you to pre-sweep each and every location on this schedule.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t want a bunch of cars parked like bullshit, blocking escape routes.\\n\\nHe\\'s looking at you, Montez.\\n\\nOf course I\\'m talking to you, you idiot.\\n\\nDon Miguel\\'s team on channel six.

That\\'s the truth.\\n\\nUntil then, we will honor our commitment to you.\\n\\nRight, and after?\\n\\nWhat happens after that?\\n\\nThe business will adjust.\\n\\nThis I know. It will always adjust. This will never end.\\n\\nThere will be other partners and more drugs. But what about you?\\n\\nWhat will happen to you?\\n\\nYou can\\'t tell me you\\'re going to retire,\\n\\nas if this was any normal business.\\n\\nYou know this is a way of life.\\n\\nIt retires you when it\\'s done with you.\\n\\nOr are you going to start playing golf like an old man?\\n\\nWe need to count on you maintaining the same terms on this last shipment.\\n\\nDone.\\n\\nIt\\'ll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.\\n\\nAll right? But... you have to come with me to Juárez.\\n\\n- I want to show you something. - What is it?\\n\\nThe future, Pacho.\\n\\nThe f*cking future, that\\'s all.\\n\\n- Here\\'s your passport. - Thank you.\\n\\nAll right, and you board through Gate 15.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\n- Have a great trip. - Thank you.\\n\\nHave a great day.\\n\\nNext.\\n\\nI\\'m going to Panama.\\n\\nI need you to radio ahead to the DEA office.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid not.

You go back to Bogotá and...\\n\\nget a warrant.\\n\\nCome on, guys, the place isn\\'t moving anywhere.\\n\\nGet that paper and we\\'ll turn this place upside down.\\n\\nWhy wait?\\n\\nJudge in Bogotá signed a warrant for us before we left.\\n\\nWhich you never told me about.\\n\\nThis is the kind of bullshit I don\\'t like.\\n\\nAre you playing me or what?\\n\\nHey, man, it\\'s like you said. It\\'s hard to know who to trust.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t even sure we were gonna need it.\\n\\nThere\\'s no address on this warrant.\\n\\nYou said this place is connected, so let\\'s put in some work.\\n\\nDo you know the kind of shit I could land in?\\n\\nHuh?\\n\\nI don\\'t have a DEA pension waiting for me.\\n\\nPensions aren\\'t that great, to be honest.\\n\\nf*ck.\\n\\nLet\\'s do it.\\n\\nI need a tactical team sent to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?\\n\\nCopy that.

These files are legit.\\n\\nHow are you guys?\\n\\nCaptain.\\n\\nWe\\'ll catalog and seal the ones from today.\\n\\nIf you could help us with transport...\\n\\nOkay... there must be a misunderstanding.\\n\\nThe files stay here.\\n\\nWe need to sort through these.\\n\\nAs you can see, we know how to process evidence, Feistl.\\n\\nThat wasn\\'t the deal. This was our intel.\\n\\nIt was a CNP operation.\\n\\nWe let you join, support.\\n\\n- Are you f*cking kidding me? - No, I\\'m not.\\n\\nI\\'m not.\\n\\nBut anything we find we\\'ll be sure to share with you.\\n\\nI was instructed you should be back in Bogotá tonight.\\n\\nYou\\'re going out on the last flight.\\n\\nHe b*rned us.\\n\\nWho\\'s that, Chris?\\n\\nThe last honest cop in Cali?\\n\\nNo, man. He clowned me, too. I\\'m calling the boss.\\n\\nf*ck!\\n\\nThose things ain\\'t going 25 feet down here.\\n\\nThanks. Hey, you DOD?\\n\\nSo they say.

Pendleton.\\n\\nI was out there teaching Saudi soldiers how to do jumping jacks.\\n\\nThat shit\\'s a lot harder than it sounds.\\n\\n- So is it really that bad down here? - Yeah. It is.\\n\\nYou got paramilitary, FARC, tr*ffick, us.\\n\\nSome pretty hairy bullshit down here.\\n\\nRight, but not hairy enough for the truth to make its case.\\n\\nMagazines on those bodies are 7.62 millimeter.\\n\\nThey go in an AK-47, right?\\n\\nThose g*n, the fancy ones, they chamber in a 5.56.\\n\\nThis whole thing is staged.\\n\\nThose are run-of-the-mill guerrillas. Peasants, not tr*ffick.\\n\\nYou know your g*n.\\n\\nI\\'m gonna head on down.\\n\\nNot very original, Stechner.\\n\\nEven for the CIA.\\n\\nYeah, well, sometimes you need to make the truth a little more... plain.\\n\\nWell, how\\'s this for truth?\\n\\nThey go home and tell everyone the w*r on drugs is a f*cking stage show.\\n\\nAnd all the money they put in is pissed away.\\n\\nEven the hero said it\\'s f*cked up.\\n\\nWhat\\'s that do to your plan?\\n\\nI\\'m gonna level with you.\\n\\nSending a five-billion-dollar aid package\\n\\nto a country that\\'s on the verge of becoming a narco-democracy,\\n\\nthat\\'s a bad look in the Senate.\\n\\nAll due respect, Senator, you\\'re looking at a petri dish for the next Castro,\\n\\nand this one\\'s fed by narco dollars.\\n\\nAnd not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.\\n\\nRich dictators with anti-American hard-ons.\\n\\nWe turn our back on this place, it all goes to hell.\\n\\nColombia is perfectly situated to help us in both Central and South America.\\n\\nThe right American footprint here, Black Hawks, small arms,\\n\\nnight vision, advisors like Mills...\\n\\nwe help secure a s*ab Colombia,\\n\\nand it becomes a beacon for the region.\\n\\nWell, if you want the American people\\n\\nto get behind sending billions of dollars to Colombia...\\n\\nwe need a no-f*cking-around victory down here.\\n\\nLook, gentlemen, the Colombian government\\n\\nis months away from dismantling one of the biggest drug cartels in history.\\n\\nAnd they will do it without f*ring a sh*t.\\n\\nNo body count, no dirty hands.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine the folks back home won\\'t like that.\\n\\nAgent Peña.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\nIs it true? Is a big win coming?\\n\\nAgent Stechner and I...\\n\\nwe have a long-standing difference of opinion on just about everything.\\n\\nBut he and I can both agree...\\n\\na big win is coming.\\n\\nGlad we\\'re on the same page, Agent Peña.\\n\\nSo the whole surrender plan is about f*cking fundraising!\\n\\nThe Colombians get a check and you get to play army men in the jungle?\\n\\nI\\'m thinking about the next battle, the one that really counts.\\n\\nWhich means you\\'re willing to lose this one!\\n\\nThe drug w*r?\\n\\nOh, come on, man! We lost it!\\n\\nYou were there!\\n\\nEver stop and think that anyone that takes this as personally as you do\\n\\nis doing it wrong?\\n\\n- f*ck you! - Yeah.\\n\\nSee ya!\\n\\nWhere are they now?\\n\\nI just put them on a plane to Bogotá.\\n\\n- And the files? - We\\'ve got them.\\n\\nAre you sure?\\n\\nLook, they tricked me with that f*cking warrant, all right?\\n\\nAnd I couldn\\'t warn you because we were all together like a f*cking family.\\n\\nThese Americans know what they\\'re doing.\\n\\nThey aren\\'t f*cking idiots.\\n\\nI ever tell you I did a rotation in Chile?\\n\\nNo, Dan, you never told me you did a rotation in f*cking Chile.\\n\\nThe accountant.\\n\\n- You clock his accent? - No.\\n\\nA little off. You know, he said something: \"Concha su madre.\"\\n\\nOkay, what\\'s that? \"f*ck your mother\" or something?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\n\"Cachai.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a phrase that they typically only use in Chile.\\n\\nAnd if he\\'s from Chile...\\n\\nHe can be extradited.\\n\\nPanama DEA said no warrant, no detention.\\n\\n- f*ck. - Plus, Jurado didn\\'t stay in Panama.\\n\\nThey know where he went?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nSo Jurado could be anywhere. f*ck!\\n\\nAlso, boss, Feistl and Van Ness have been trying you. A lot.\\n\\nAll right, well, put them through when you get them. I\\'m on my way back.\\n\\n- And Stoddard? - Yeah, boss?\\n\\nJurado has a wife in Bogotá. She\\'s American.\\n\\nPut a tap on her phone.\\n\\n- I don\\'t think I can do that. - Just do it.\\n\\nWell, the truth is, we\\'re very interested in your proposal, Jorge.\\n\\nAnd in your potential for growth.\\n\\nYou\\'ve exceeded Paola\\'s description,\\n\\nwhich wasn\\'t easy.\\n\\nOf course, we were inconvenienced by the six-month delay, which...\\n\\ntook us by surprise.\\n\\nI take my commitments very seriously, gentlemen.\\n\\nAnd I couldn\\'t leave without ensuring my replacement met the standard\\n\\nthey\\'ve come to expect.\\n\\nGo wait for him over there.\\n\\n- Good evening. How are you? - Good, thank you.\\n\\nWell, I think that merits another bottle of wine, no?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nLook at that son of a bitch.\\n\\nThinks his shit doesn\\'t stink, or what?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSo, a security expert married to a rising star\\n\\nin one of Cali\\'s top law firms.\\n\\nHave you worked together before?\\n\\nMy compliments.\\n\\nDavid Rodríguez.\\n\\nHow are you?\\n\\nDon\\'t let the elegant suit fool you.\\n\\nThis guy\\'s a real son of a bitch.\\n\\nSeriously.\\n\\nIn fact, he\\'s one of our best men.\\n\\nYou see?\\n\\nEnjoy it.\\n\\nMa\\'am.\\n\\nYou... Where do you know him from? Is he a friend of yours?\\n\\nYou know Cali is a very small city.\\n\\nEven more so when one is in the security business.\\n\\nOne must deal with all sorts of people.\\n\\nIs that the paperwork I\\'m supposed to deliver?\\n\\nThese documents are very sensitive.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t feel comfortable transferring possession to anyone else.\\n\\nAll right. Let\\'s go, then.\\n\\nOpen the door, Córdova.\\n\\nGo f*ck yourself, Pallomari.\\n\\n- Huh? - In the front seat.\\n\\nWhat the f*ck\\'s wrong with you?

Ridiculous.\\n\\nWhat do you think I should do? Call Pablo and tell him I won\\'t pay it?\\n\\n- Obviously not. - Then I don\\'t understand.\\n\\n- What do you want me to do? - It\\'s not right, Kiko, and you know it.\\n\\nLook, I... adore Pablo. I adore him.\\n\\nBut the thing is, I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with him these days.\\n\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe he\\'s depressed.\\n\\nWe\\'re here in a Jacuzzi...\\n\\nfree.\\n\\n- Do you love me? - Oh...\\n\\nStop f*cking around. You make me angry.\\n\\nAgainst orders, we did high-altitude flyovers of the prison\\n\\n- with our infrared cameras. - No tunnels.\\n\\nTomography report indicates nothing. Seismic measuring, nada.\\n\\nCan we measure radio frequency energy?\\n\\nWell, we could try. Doesn\\'t penetrate deeper than 30 feet.\\n\\nIf he\\'s bringing shit into this tunnel, you can bet he\\'s going out that way.\\n\\nIf there\\'s a tunnel there, he must have dug it to China.\\n\\nGood luck.\\n\\nMaybe we can...\\n\\nWe can ask the military to do light detection and ranging.\\n\\nWe got a better chance of Noonan authorizing a divining rod.\\n\\n- All right, man, I\\'m calling it a night. - Nah, finish up.\\n\\nNo, you can\\'t even smoke in here.\\n\\nNo luck?\\n\\nThese aerials don\\'t indicate a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.\\n\\nHm.\\n\\nWell, the only thing I can see in all of them is this truck.\\n\\n- Are you finished with that, honey? - Yeah.\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nDid it stop?\\n\\nGood morning.\\n\\n- What\\'s up? - Are you \"The Paisa\"?\\n\\n- Yes. - Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.\\n\\nDo me a favor and get out of the truck.\\n\\n- What\\'s going on? - Don\\'t be afraid.\\n\\nUp against the truck.\\n\\nLet\\'s go.\\n\\nDo me another favor.\\n\\nOpen it up.\\n\\nGo on.\\n\\nWe missed a very important delivery.\\n\\nSex toys, back issues of Hustler, a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.\\n\\nHe\\'s bored shitless in there.\\n\\nLook, gringos... you don\\'t have the right to do this.\\n\\nOf course we have the right.\\n\\nYou just press the button in the truck and we will do the rest, OK?\\n\\nIf the boss finds out that I let you put cameras in the truck, he\\'ll k*ll me.\\n\\nWhat did he say?\\n\\nHe says if Pablo finds out, he\\'ll k*ll him.\\n\\nAmigo...\\n\\nPablo\\'s your boss?\\n\\nYeah? Yeah.\\n\\nI am your boss. Yes?\\n\\nIt\\'s OK, it\\'s OK! I\\'ll do whatever you say.\\n\\nYeah?\\n\\nAre you OK, friend?\\n\\nGood day.\\n\\nSo what is this? What am I looking at exactly?\\n\\n- Club Medellín. - This was all shipped in to La Catedral.\\n\\nWe got some big-screen TVs, nice stereo equipment.\\n\\nThat\\'s a roulette wheel, a little bit of liquor.\\n\\nGlad to see the judges could come down with the official from the airport.\\n\\nJavi\\'s pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the jukebox with the hookers.\\n\\nOf course, the lobster.\\n\\n- This is a-- - Yes, it\\'s a roulette wheel.\\n\\nHe has a casino right there at La Catedral.\\n\\n- Where did you get these pictures? - From the DEA.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just these pictures.\\n\\nThey also have pictures of judges, local government people,\\n\\nother narcos, prost*tute... Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.\\n\\n- Who else has seen these? - No one, as far as I know.\\n\\n- That\\'s why we have to act now.\\n\\nDo you think the DEA is capable of leaking the photos to the media?\\n\\nThe DEA is capable of anything. That\\'s why we have to do something now.\\n\\nAt one time, Escobar... used to own all of Colombia.\\n\\nNow he\\'s just the owner of his own prison.\\n\\nIf I had to choose between prost*tute at La Catedral...\\n\\nor b*mb in the country...\\n\\nI would be eternally grateful to these women.\\n\\nHappy birthday, Pablo!\\n\\n- Watch your step. - Careful with the little girl!\\n\\nHow are you? Welcome.\\n\\n- Happy birthday. - Hello, sweetheart.\\n\\nThey\\'re the ones I hired? I don\\'t believe you.\\n\\nThey are really good, Blackie. I like them.\\n\\nCome on, Pablo, tell us... what are you doing these days? Hm!\\n\\n- How do you spend your time? - Aside from missing his family?\\n\\nOh! Of course.\\n\\n- He\\'s writing a book. - Mm!\\n\\n- Mother. - What?\\n\\nIsn\\'t it true? You are writing a book.\\n\\nPlease, Mom.\\n\\nWell, then, you tell them.\\n\\n- It\\'s a collection of magazine articles. - Many articles.\\n\\n- Clippings. It\\'s a book of cartoons. - Oh, cartoons!\\n\\nFrom newspapers and magazines all over the world.\\n\\nAnd you know what? People write him every day.\\n\\n- It\\'s because they love him. - I can imagine.\\n\\nYou have to find ways to keep your mind occupied around here.\\n\\nYes, my love. And you have Judy\\'s husband and Galeano to help you with the business.\\n\\nYes, on that note, Kiko is so grateful to you\\n\\nfor all the responsibilities you have given him.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\n- We were in Cartagena-- - Where?\\n\\n- We were in Cartagena last week. - Oh, yeah?\\n\\nOh, yes, we spent some beautiful days there relaxing.\\n\\nIt must feel good to be able to relax like that.\\n\\n- How nice. - Wonderful, Tata. You can\\'t imagine.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll tell you, Cartagena is really expensive.\\n\\nOh, it\\'s unaffordable.\\n\\nBesides, this whole \"w*r with Cali\" thing,\\n\\nit\\'s tough, you know, with the tax we have to pay.\\n\\nWe understand it\\'s not easy, but there\\'s not much we can do.\\n\\nIt\\'s OK.\\n\\nKiko complained about that?\\n\\nHe mentioned it.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t complain, Pablo, he didn\\'t complain.\\n\\nEveryone here is absolutely aware of the huge sacrifice that you\\'re making,\\n\\nfor God\\'s sake. So I think it\\'s normal, right?\\n\\nIt\\'s normal that we\\'d give you our support.\\n\\nWell, I think it\\'s normal... I really do.\\n\\nJuan Pablito, go play with your dad for a little while, OK?\\n\\nHoney, you should play with the kids a little bit.\\n\\nLeave the gift here.\\n\\nI\\'ll look after it.\\n\\nThe word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn\\'t gonna do shit about Escobar\\'s violations.\\n\\nCarrillo was right. He won.\\n\\nWhat are those?\\n\\nThese are a list of, uh... my accomplishments.\\n\\nYou shred these.\\n\\nApologize!\\n\\nApologize!\\n\\nApologize!\\n\\n- Were you watching? - Yes.\\n\\nYou apologize!\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, boss.\\n\\nI didn\\'t mean it.\\n\\n- Relax. - Are you all right, boss?\\n\\nRelax. That\\'s how the game goes.\\n\\nGo on, go on. You guys continue.\\n\\nAre you all right, sir?\\n\\nBoss.\\n\\nExcuse me, boss, but I need to speak to you.\\n\\nEverything OK?\\n\\n- Boss, we have a problem. - What problem?\\n\\nYou remember that Moncada and Galeano had a large shipment\\n\\n- that was seized in Boyacá? - Yes.\\n\\n- 250 kilos. - Exactly.\\n\\nCan you imagine, a farmer found three million dollars buried in a field?\\n\\nDo you know where that was, boss?\\n\\nIn Rionegro.\\n\\nTrue story. And pay attention, because it changes a lot of lives.\\n\\nRemember how I told you that the cartel was making so much money\\n\\nthat they had to bury it?\\n\\nAnd Blackbeard had the treasure map.\\n\\nWell, after we got him, he gave a lot of it up...\\n\\nbut not all of it.\\n\\nIt just so happens that one day, out in a field in Rionegro,\\n\\na farmer who worked for Galeano and Moncada found one.\\n\\nAt first, the poor guy thought he\\'d dug up a body.\\n\\nOver the years, plenty of \\'em had been buried out in the fields.\\n\\nThe farmer knew right away it was narco money.\\n\\nHe was terrified he might get buried himself if he took it.\\n\\nSo he took the money to a guy who was connected,\\n\\nwho took it to another guy...\\n\\nwho took it to Pablo\\'s sicario lieutenant... Velasco.\\n\\nThere\\'s cash buried everywhere.\\n\\nThe guerillas, the paramilitary, the narcos...\\n\\n- Everybody\\'s burying cash. - Yes, I know.\\n\\nBut right on Moncada and Galeano\\'s property?\\n\\nDon\\'t you think that\\'s strange, boss?\\n\\nI think it\\'s strange.\\n\\nLook. All this cash...\\n\\nwas found... in a field.\\n\\n- That\\'s good luck, Pablo.\\n\\nOr it could be bad luck. For you both.\\n\\nIt was on your property, in Rionegro.\\n\\nBut Pablo, those lands are over 300 acres,\\n\\nand most of us rent out to the farmers.\\n\\nMm.\\n\\nYou told me that you had a 250-kilo shipment seized.\\n\\nThat\\'s true.\\n\\nThe shipment equaled that amount of cash.\\n\\nWho told you to open your mouth?\\n\\nNot true? Hm?\\n\\nPablo, do you think we\\'re stealing from you?\\n\\nThat we made up that whole story about the seizure?\\n\\nIf you\\'d like, check with the cops in Boyacá.\\n\\nRight, because cops in Boyacá are so honest, right?\\n\\nKeep in mind that we bought that property from Gustavo.\\n\\nI even remember Gustavo saying that you had cash stashed in every corner.\\n\\nGustavo... would never forget where he buried cash.\\n\\nWho\\'s putting this shit in your head, Pablo? These assholes?\\n\\nThese f*ck would sell their own mother.\\n\\n- We are partners and friends. - Mm.\\n\\nMaybe that cash was lost because I raised the tax?\\n\\nBullshit. I paid the tax and never complained.\\n\\nThat\\'s a lie.\\n\\n- Because you complained to your wife. - I haven\\'t complained.\\n\\nYou have no idea what I talk about with Judy.\\n\\nI understand this is difficult for you, Pablo--\\n\\nWhat is difficult for me?\\n\\nWell, managing all of this. That\\'s why you hired us.\\n\\n- So we can manage it and look after it. - Mm.\\n\\nYou trust us, right?\\n\\nI understand this makes you anxious--\\n\\n- Do I look anxious? - No, I didn\\'t mean that.\\n\\n- You said with certainty that-- - No, no, what I meant to say was--\\n\\n- I think you\\'re the one who\\'s anxious. - We didn\\'t do shit, Pablo!\\n\\nWith that tone of yours... you\\'re telling me you didn\\'t do shit?\\n\\nLike I was some kind of idiot. Is this my cash or not?!\\n\\nNo, Pablo.\\n\\nDid you take it and bury it in Rionegro or not?!\\n\\nFor sure, these guys hid your cash, boss.\\n\\n- It\\'s the truth, you pair of liars. - Of course, he--\\n\\n- Shut up, f*ck! - You\\'re petty thieves!\\n\\nYou shut up, f*ck! Don\\'t you disrespect me!\\n\\nPablo, look at me, man.\\n\\nWe\\'re family.\\n\\nYou\\'re my daughter\\'s godfather.\\n\\nAnd also godfather to Galeano\\'s kids.\\n\\nWhat\\'s going on?\\n\\nWe\\'re like brothers.\\n\\nWe\\'re partners and friends.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been in this our whole lives, Pablo.\\n\\nWe made our first trip to Miami together.\\n\\nWe made so much cash together that we don\\'t even know what we spent it on.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the problem?\\n\\nWhat\\'s happening?\\n\\nThe two of us love you very much.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re very grateful.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nBeing stuck in here...\\n\\ncan make someone paranoid.\\n\\n- Paisa! Paisa!\\n\\nWell, man, these things happen, right?\\n\\nWe\\'re here for whatever you need. Trust us.\\n\\nI\\'m going to make a trip to Miami.\\n\\nI\\'ll bring you a few little things to keep you entertained, OK?\\n\\nDon Pablo.\\n\\nPablo, don\\'t do it! Pablo, no!\\n\\nYou\\'re a dog, you son of a bitch!\\n\\nWhat does it feel like to take a shit on your own empire?\\n\\nYou want us to tell you that we stole the money?\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you\\'ll believe whatever you want, f*ck.\\n\\nGoodbye, Kiko.\\n\\nk*ll me if you\\'re such a man, f*ck.\\n\\nk*ll me with your own f*cking hands!\\n\\nWho are you talking to, assh*le?\\n\\nf*ck!\\n\\nWait a second!\\n\\nBe careful, man.\\n\\nLook what the d*ad guy gave me.\\n\\nWhat the f*ck! You\\'re going to burn all the meat!\\n\\nWhat is wrong with you? Can\\'t you see I\\'m doing it to cover the smell?\\n\\n- Yeah, but let\\'s not burn it all. - What are we gonna do with all this meat?\\n\\n- What are you going to do? - What am I supposed to do?\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nBoss, are you OK?\\n\\nDo you need anything, boss?\\n\\nWe\\'re grilling some meat. Do you want some?\\n\\nNo. I\\'m not hungry.\\n\\nNavegante.\\n\\nBoss.\\n\\n- Do you want me to wax it? - No, relax.\\n\\nThis one\\'s my favorite. I enjoy it.\\n\\nThis is a beautiful car.\\n\\nAnything new on Galeano and Moncada?\\n\\nLooks like the rumors are true, boss.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame.\\n\\nI warned them.\\n\\nAs the twig is bent, so grows the tree.\\n\\nDo you still have that DEA contact?\\n\\nJavier Peña? Of course.\\n\\nI want you to contact him and confirm the rumors.\\n\\nThey\\'re just as interested in screwing Escobar as we are.\\n\\nI haven\\'t heard from him since yesterday.\\n\\nI\\'ve called everyone. I\\'m so worried.\\n\\nPablo told me that they left La Catedral.\\n\\nJust relax, sweetie.\\n\\nYour husband is fine.\\n\\nNo. No, thank you.\\n\\nMaybe... they had to go somewhere else urgently?\\n\\nOr maybe they left without saying anything.\\n\\nThe way our men usually do.\\n\\nYes, but it\\'s a little strange, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nKiko was very clear that he had a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.\\n\\nHe said he would be home later.\\n\\nWe\\'re trying to have another baby. I think I told you that.\\n\\nNo? We\\'re trying to have another baby, and the time is right,\\n\\nso we had a very important date to keep.\\n\\nAre you sure that Pablo told you that Kiko left La Catedral?\\n\\nAre you telling me that my husband is a liar?\\n\\nI want my husband back.\\n\\nIf Pablo told Tata that they left...\\n\\nit\\'s because they left.\\n\\nListen... Pablo is your kids\\' godfather.\\n\\nHe would never hurt them.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about Don Pablo Escobar.\\n\\nThere are rumors that he k*ll Galeano and Moncada.\\n\\nWhere, in jail?\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\n\"In jail.\"\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t make any sense. They\\'re partners.\\n\\nMaybe there is not such thing as sense with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.\\n\\nBullshit. Where\\'d you get it?\\n\\nThe relatives of the men he k*ll... are up in arms.\\n\\nThe poor fellows went in, but they never got out.\\n\\nI want to ask you gentlemen a serious question now.\\n\\nHow bad do you want Escobar?\\n\\nHow far are you willing to go in this matter?\\n\\nWhat are you proposing?\\n\\nWell, we both have access to information that could benefit the other.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nNo, we don\\'t trade information.\\n\\n- Just hold on a second. - No.\\n\\nHe\\'s an informant, Javi.\\n\\nWhatever you got cookin\\', it stinks.

businessmen\\n\\n- suddenly came up with so much cash.\\n- Gustavo, brother...\\n\\njust launder the money.\\n\\nMake it look legitimate...\\nthat\\'s all.\\n\\nIsn\\'t that what Al Capone did?\\n\\n- Al Capone?\\n- Al Capone.\\n\\nYou\\'re a dumbass, Pablo.\\n\\n- Al Capone is a terrible example.\\n- Why?\\n\\nBecause Al Capone\\nnever had this much cash.\\n\\nThis is too much to launder.\\n\\nWell, then...\\n\\nlet\\'s buy a bigger washing machine.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s what they tried first.\\n\\nOn paper, Pablo had\\nthe most profitable taxi company ever.\\n\\nHe only had three cars,\\n\\nbut he was pulling in\\nmore than five million dollars a week.\\n\\nAnd Gacha had the most successful\\nemerald mine of all time.\\n\\nHe would inject bad stones with oil\\nto make them shiny,\\n\\nthen have his friends in Miami\\nbuy the emeralds with drug money\\n\\nand give them as gifts\\nto hookers in town.\\n\\nEverybody was happy.\\n\\nBut no matter what they did,\\nthey couldn\\'t hide all that money.\\n\\nIt just kept coming in.\\n\\nYou\\'re spending too much cash, Pablo.\\n\\nYou have Picassos, Dalís, farms,\\n\\nhouses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...\\n\\nI told you we have to fly low.\\n\\nIf you keep spending like that,\\nyou\\'re going to end up in Forbes Magazine.\\n\\nAnd if that happens,\\nthe government is going to have our asses.\\n\\nEnough, Gustavo, enough.\\n\\nWhat do you want me to say?\\n\\nBury it.\\n\\n- How\\'s that?\\n- Bury the cash.\\n\\nAnd cut the bullshit.\\n\\nGo on, p*ssy.\\n\\n- And that\\'s what they did.\\n\\nThey buried it in fields...\\n\\nthey hid it in caletas,\\nhiding places in walls and ceilings.\\n\\nThey even stuck a million dollars\\nin Pablo\\'s mother\\'s couch.\\n\\nHey, Mom.\\n\\n- I\\'m praying, Pablo.\\n- Just for a second.\\n\\nSit.\\n\\nIt isn\\'t very comfortable, Pablito.\\n\\nI\\'ll buy you another sofa later.\\n\\nWouldn\\'t it be better\\nif you put all this money in a bank, son?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAll bankers are bandits.\\n\\nReally, honey?\\n\\nPablo called this accountant \"Blackbeard,\"\\n\\nnot because he looked like a pirate,\\n\\nbut because his job was to map out\\nwhere the treasure was hidden.\\n\\nBut not even the pirate did the trick.\\n\\nThe problem was Colombia itself.\\n\\nIt was too small a country\\nfor a fortune that big.\\n\\nIt was inevitable... someone, somewhere\\nwould try to snatch the narcos\\' treasure.\\n\\nForbes Magazine says...\\n\\nthat the narcos have more money\\n\\nthan the richest capitalist pig\\nin this

you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nNo one\\'s crazy enough\\nto kidnap drug dealers, right?\\n\\nBut if you\\'re thinking that, it\\'s because\\nyou\\'re not familiar with M-19.\\n\\n- M-19 was a communist guerrilla group\\n\\nmade up of college students\\nand intellectuals\\n\\nwho read too much Karl Marx\\nfor their own good.\\n\\nTheir leader was\\nIvan \"the Terrible\" Torres...\\n\\na history

girlfriend, Elisa,\\n\\nand stole a national treasure...\\nthe sword of Simón Bolívar,\\n\\nthe mythic general who led Colombia\\nto independence from the Spanish empire.\\n\\nThese jokers even left a note:\\n\\n\"Bolívar, your sword\\nreturns to the battlefield.\"\\n\\nIt was a stroke of genius...\\na marketing stunt way ahead of its time.\\n\\nAnd it made them famous overnight.\\n\\nAnd I guess it went to their heads.\\n\\nWhat about Pablo Escobar?\\nHe\\'s the richest of them all.\\n\\nEscobar gives money to the poor.\\n\\nYou\\'re right.\\nEscobar is a man of the people.\\n\\nHe\\'s all right with me.\\n\\nOK, then.\\n\\n- Let\\'s do the Ochoas.\\n\\nMarch 13th, 1981,\\nthe day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,\\n\\nwas also the day the Lion\\ncompleted 100 trips to Miami.\\n\\n-

All right. Perfect.\\n\\nDuring the early \\'80s,\\nmost flights out of Bogot?\\n\\nhad several mules on them.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t even know about each other.\\n\\nAnd you know what?\\n\\nGetting in was easy, because nobody\\nworried about cocaine in America.\\n\\nAll we cared about was grass.\\n\\nPretty soon, cocaine was hidden in\\nalmost every legitimate Colombian export.\\n\\nFish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...\\nanything.\\n\\nBut even that didn\\'t do it.\\n\\nThe real game changer was filling\\nLehder\\'s planes with coke instead of weed.\\n\\nDo you trust this guy?\\n\\nI don\\'t know.\\nHe was in prison in the United States.\\n\\n- So is he gay or what?\\n- Oh, for sure he\\'s gay.\\n\\nBut he\\'s got good routes.\\n\\n- Amigos!\\n- Hello, Carlos.\\n\\nGustavo Gaviria,\\nnice to meet you.\\n\\n- Nice to meet you.\\n- My cousin.\\n\\nPablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.\\nNice to meet you.\\n\\n- Cousin?

Same old contraband routes.\\n- Mm.\\n\\nBe careful, guys. If we all start\\nbuying potatoes at the same time,\\n\\nthe Peruvians will raise the price.\\n\\nThey also grow potatoes in Bolivia.\\n\\nWe can reduce the cost of\\nthe refining process if we buy together.\\n\\nWell, guys, the hard part\\nis getting the merchandise to Miami.\\n\\nYou need a lot of creativity for that.\\n\\nHow much would you charge us\\nto be \"creative\"?\\n\\nYou deliver the product to me, labeled.\\n\\nI will take it to Miami\\nand deliver it to your contact there.\\n\\nBetter yet, Lehder will do it.\\n\\nI\\'ll charge 35 percent of the sales value,\\n\\nbut I\\'ll insure the safety of your load\\nup to 50 percent of the value.\\n\\nThe potato business is ours.\\nWe don\\'t need...\\n\\nDeal?\\n\\nDeal.\\n\\nSounds good to me.\\n\\nAll right,\\nI will create my own routes\\n\\nand stop using your services\\nas soon as possible.
